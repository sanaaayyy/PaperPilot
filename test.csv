705.1561,Graviton Propagator in a Covariant Massive Gravity Theory,"  We study the massive gravity theory proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Georgi and Schwartz. In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covariance is spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links two metrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this ""link"" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. We work out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of gauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge theories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level interaction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result is independent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction of massless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains even if the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massive and massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauli graviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more general theory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory in which the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is different from the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry under conformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes to zero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that the local Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fully nonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.

All the parameters labeling a half-BPS surface operator are identified in the corresponding bubbling geometry. We use the supergravity description of surface operators to study the action of the SL(2,Z) duality group of N=4 SYM on the parameters of the surface operator, and find that it coincides with the recent proposal by Gukov and Witten in the framework of the gauge theory approach to the geometrical Langlands with ramification.

706.1144,Block scaling in the directed percolation universality class,"  The universal behaviour of the directed percolation universality class is well understood, both the critical scaling as well as finite size scaling. This article focuses on the block (finite size) scaling of the order parameter and its fluctuations, considering (sub-)blocks of linear size l in systems of linear size L. The scaling depends on the choice of the ensemble, as only the conditional ensemble produces the block-scaling behaviour as established in equilibrium critical phenomena. The dependence on the ensemble can be understood by an additional symmetry present in the unconditional ensemble. The unconventional scaling found in the unconditional ensemble is a reminder of the possibility that scaling functions themselves have a power-law dependence on their arguments.

704.1864,High purity bright single photon source,"  Using cavity-enhanced non-degenerate parametric downconversion, we have built a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and homodyne measurement.

706.0135,Theory of New Quantum Oscillations in the Magnetoresistance of Graphene   Layers,  We present a theory presenting new quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance that are revealed as fine structures superimposed to the Schubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. They may be observed in experiments on graphene layers as fine structures that until now seem to have been overseen or considered to be noise. These oscillations appear also in the behaviour of the resistance as a function of the gate voltage that changes the number of carriers or Fermi level. Experimental studies of these resonances should give information of the uniformity and defects of the samples and represent a new fine structure spectroscopy. Also the lateral sample size and quantum effects may explain the absence of magnetoresistance in a few grapheme layers.

705.4149,What happened to the Cosmological QCD Phase Transition?,"  The scenario that some first-order phase transitions may have taken place in the early Universe offers us one of the most intriguing and fascinating questions in cosmology. Indeed, the role played by the latent ""heat"" or energy released in the phase transition is highly nontrivial and may lead to some surprising, important results. In this paper, we take the wisdom that the cosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec and 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order. To get the essence out of the scenario, it is sufficient to approximate the true QCD vacuum as one of degenerate theta-vacua and when necessary we try to model it effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking. We examine how and when ""pasted"" or ""patched"" domain walls are formed, how long such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language, there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of ""pasted"" or ""patched"" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved objects, should make the concept of the ""radiation-dominated"" epoch, or of the ""matter-dominated"" epoch to be re-examined.

704.2394,Muon Physics: A Pillar of the Standard Model,"  Since its discovery in the 1930s, the muon has played an important role in our quest to understand the sub-atomic theory of matter. The muon was the first second-generation standard-model particle to be discovered, and its decay has provided information on the (Vector -Axial Vector) structure of the weak interaction, the strength of the weak interaction, G_F, and the conservation of lepton number (flavor) in muon decay. The muon's anomalous magnetic moment has played an important role in restricting theories of physics beyond the standard standard model, where at present there is a 3.4 standard-deviation difference between the experiment and standard-model theory. Its capture on the atomic nucleus has provided valuable information on the modification of the weak current by the strong interaction which is complementary to that obtained from nuclear beta decay.

705.2457,Analysis of Spitzer Spectra of Irradiated Planets: Evidence for Water   Vapor?,"  Published mid infrared spectra of transiting planets HD 209458b and HD 189733b, obtained during secondary eclipse by the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, are predominantly featureless. In particular these flux ratio spectra do not exhibit an expected feature arising from water vapor absorption short-ward of 10 um. Here we suggest that, in the absence of flux variability, the spectral data for HD 189733b are inconsistent with 8 um-photometry obtained with Spitzer's InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), perhaps an indication of problems with the challenging reduction of the IRS spectra. The IRAC point, along with previously published secondary eclipse photometry for HD 189733b, are in good agreement with a one-dimensional model of HD 189733b that clearly shows absorption due to water vapor in the emergent spectrum. We are not able to draw firm conclusions regarding the IRS data for HD 209458b, but spectra predicted by 1D and 3D atmosphere models fit the data adequately, without adjustment of the water abundance or reliance on cloud opacity.

705.1946,Novel Josephson Effects in d-wave Superconductor Junctions with   Antiferromagnetic Interlayers,"  We calculate the dc supercurrent through a Josephson tunnel junction consisting of an antiferromagnetic (AF) interlayer sandwiched between two d-wave superconductors (d). Such d/AF/d junctions exhibit a rich dependence of the Josephson current on the interlayer parameters, including the possibility of 0-pi transitions with varying temperature or interlayer thickness. Furthermore, we study d/I/d junctions when the dSC leads include subdominant magnetic correlations. In this case induced magnetism near the interface can strongly diminish the critical current for 110 oriented junctions whereas no suppression is obtained for the 100 orientation.

This has motivated us to continue intra-night optical monitoring of bona-fide radio-quiet quasars (RQQs). Here we present the results for a sample of 11 RQQs monitored by us on 19 nights. On 5 of these nights a given RQQ was monitored simultaneously from two well separated observatories. In all, two clear cases and two probable case of INOV were detected. From these data, we estimate an INOV duty cycle of $\sim$8% for RQQs which would increase to 19% if the `probable variable' cases are also included. Such comparatively small INOV duty cycles for RQQs, together with the small INOV amplitudes ($\sim$1%), are in accord with the previously deduced characteristics of this phenomenon.

706.0796,Continuous loading of $^{1}$S$_{0}$ calcium atoms into an optical dipole   trap,"  We demonstrate an efficient scheme for continuous trap loading based upon spatially selective optical pumping. We discuss the case of $^{1}$S$_{0}$ calcium atoms in an optical dipole trap (ODT), however, similar strategies should be applicable to a wide range of atomic species. Our starting point is a reservoir of moderately cold ($\approx 300 \mu$K) metastable $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms prepared by means of a magneto-optic trap (triplet-MOT). A focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for $^{1}$S$_{0}$-atoms with up to 350 $\mu$K well depth. A weak focused laser beam at 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state, where they are confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into the ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$. Limited by evaporation loss, in 200 ms we typically load $5 \times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85 $\mu$K. After terminating the loading we observe evaporation during 50 ms leaving us with $10^5$ atoms at radial temperatures close to 40 $\mu$K and a peak phase space density of $6.8 \times 10^{-5}$.

704.0794,Constraints on the Interactions between Dark Matter and Baryons from the   X-ray Quantum Calorimetry Experiment,"  Although the rocket-based X-ray Quantum Calorimetry (XQC) experiment was designed for X-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, its low atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among the most sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactions between dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independent interactions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analytical estimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range of nucleon-scattering cross sections centered around one barn for dark matter particles with masses between 0.01 and 10^5 GeV. Our analysis also provides new constraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly interacts with baryons.

705.3295,Computer simulation of model cohesive powders: influence of assembling   procedure and contact laws on low consolidation states,"  The structure and mechanical properties of a simple two-dimensional model of a cohesive powder are investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range attraction and, possibly, rolling resistance (RR) in contacts. The microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size.

705.3704,Variation of fundamental constants: theory and observations,"  Review of recent works devoted to the variation of the fundamental constants is presented including atomic clocks, quasar absorption spectra, and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data. Assuming linear variation with time we can compare different results. From the quasar absorption spectra:   $\dot{\mu}/\mu=(1 \pm 3) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. A combination of this result and the atomic clock results gives the best limt on variation of $\alpha$: $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha=(-0.8 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. The Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of $m_s/\Lambda_{QCD}$ where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass.

704.3021,On the Critical Ionization Velocity Effect in Interstellar Space and   Possible Detection of Related Continuum Emission,"  Interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission spectra manifest several families of linewidths whose numerical values (34, 13 & 6 km/s) appear to be related to the critical ionization velocities (CIVs) of the most abundant interstellar atomic species. Extended new analysis of HI emission profiles shows that the 34 km/s wide component, probably corresponding to the CIV for helium, is pervasive. The 34 km/s wide linewidth family is found in low-velocity (local) neutral hydrogen (HI) profiles as well as in the so-called high-velocity clouds. In addition, published studies of HI linewidths found in the Magellanic Stream, Very-High-Velocity Clouds, and Compact High-Velocity Clouds, all of which are believed to be intergalactic, have noted that typical values are of the same order. If the critical ionization velocity effect does play a role in interstellar space it may be expected to produce locally enhanced electron densities where rapidly moving neutral gas masses interact with surrounding plasma. Evidence is presented that suggests that this phenomenon is occurring in interstellar space. It manifests as a spatial association between peaks in HI structure offset with respect to peaks in high-frequency radio continuum data obtained with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

706.1029,Inhomogeneities in the Universe and the Fitting Problem,"  Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce ``on the mean'' our observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the framework of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre cosmology where large scale homogeneity is assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW model from observational data is the ``fitting problem'' brought to general attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's.

The simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5 Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18.

705.1816,Gravitational effects in ultrahigh-energy string scattering,"  Ultrahigh-energy string scattering is investigated to clarify the relative role of string and gravitational effects, and their possible contributions to nonlocal behavior. Different regimes can be characterized by varying the impact parameter at fixed energy. In the regime where momentum transfers reach the string scale, string effects appear subdominant to higher-loop gravitational processes, approximated via the eikonal. At smaller impact parameters, ""diffractive"" or ""tidal"" string excitation leads to processes dominated by highly excited strings.

Ultrahigh-energy string scattering is investigated to clarify the relative role of string and gravitational effects, and their possible contributions to nonlocal behavior. Different regimes can be characterized by varying the impact parameter at fixed energy. In the regime where momentum transfers reach the string scale, string effects appear subdominant to higher-loop gravitational processes, approximated via the eikonal. At smaller impact parameters, ""diffractive"" or ""tidal"" string excitation leads to processes dominated by highly excited strings.

Here we analyze for the first time the Sagnac effect in a mesoscopic semiconductor electron interferometer. We include in our analysis Rashba spin-orbit interactions in the ring.

706.1,Ab initio statistical mechanics of surface adsorption and desorption: I.   H$_2$O on MgO (001) at low coverage,"  We present a general computational scheme based on molecular dynamics (m.d.) simulation for calculating the chemical potential of adsorbed molecules in thermal equilibrium on the surface of a material. The scheme is based on the calculation of the mean force in m.d. simulations in which the height of a chosen molecule above the surface is constrained, and subsequent integration of the mean force to obtain the potential of mean force and hence the chemical potential. The scheme is valid at any coverage and temperature, so that in principle it allows the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of coverage and temperature. It avoids all statistical mechanical approximations, except for the use of classical statistical mechanics for the nuclei, and assumes nothing in advance about the adsorption sites. From the chemical potential, the absolute desorption rate of the molecules can be computed, provided the equilibration rate on the surface is faster than the desorption rate. We apply the theory by {\em ab initio} m.d. simulation to the case of H$_2$O on MgO (001) in the low-coverage limit, using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of exchange-correlation. The calculations yield an {\em ab initio} value of the Polanyi-Wigner frequency prefactor, which is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the value of $10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ often assumed in the past. Provisional comparison with experiment suggests that the PBE adsorption energy may be too low, but the extension of the calculations to higher coverages is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. The possibility of including quantum nuclear effects by using path-integral simulations is noted.

Operationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations in density functional theory applied to N-body density correlations. While the original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is in very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at arbitrary coupling.

Thus, we provide a sketch of a mechanism that breaks the $SO(d)$ color invariance and generates the Einstein-Hilbert term, as well as a cosmological constant term, allowing an interpretation of the model as a modified gravity in the Palatini formalism.

704.0911,Smooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields,"  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and mergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails, tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts. Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails, indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a 5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to 1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their separations are about the same.

704.2997,A Possible Stellar Metallic Enhancement in Post-T Tauri Stars by a   Planetesimal Bombardment,"  The photospheres of stars hosting planets have larger metallicity than stars lacking planets. In the present work we study the possibility of an earlier metal enrichment of the photospheres by means of impacting planetesimals during the first 20-30Myr. Here we explore this contamination process by simulating the interactions of an inward migrating planet with a disc of planetesimal interior to its orbit. The results show the percentage of planetesimals that fall on the star. We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity ($e_p$) and time scale of migration ($\tau$) on the rate of infalling planetesimals. For very fast migrations ($\tau=10^2$yr and $\tau=10^3$yr) there is no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of $e_p$. Then, due to the planet's migration the planetesimals suffer close approaches with the planet and more than 80% of them are ejected from the system. For slow migrations ($\tau=10^5$yr and $\tau=10^6$yr) the percentage of collisions with the planet decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity. For $e_p=0$ and $e_p=0.1$ most of the planetesimals were captured in the 2:1 resonance and more than 65% of them collided with the star. Whereas migration of a Jupiter mass planet to very short pericentric distances requires unrealistic high disc masses, these requirements are much smaller for smaller migrating planets. Our simulations for a slowly migrating 0.1 $M_{\rm Jupiter}$ planet, even demanding a possible primitive disc three times more massive than a primitive solar nebula, produces maximum [Fe/H] enrichments of the order of 0.18 dex. These calculations open possibilities to explain hot Jupiters exoplanets metallicities. ",astro-ph,"A Possible Stellar Metallic Enhancement in Post-T Tauri Stars by a   Planetesimal Bombardment.

Additivity of the multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the multipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based on taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to construct measures of entanglement based on the {\it mixed convex roof} of a quantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves optimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the decompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these results we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount of multipartite distillable key.

706.0211,Red Sequence Cluster Finding in the Millennium Simulation,"  We investigate halo mass selection properties of red-sequence cluster finders using galaxy populations of the Millennium Simulation (MS). A clear red sequence exists for MS galaxies in massive halos at redshifts z < 1, and we use this knowledge to inform a cluster-finding algorithm applied to 500 Mpc/h projections of the simulated volume. At low redshift (z=0.4), we find that 90% of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space halo, and that 10% are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster's membership. At z=1, the fraction of blends increases to 22%, as weaker redshift evolution in observed color extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of color. Other factors contributing to the increased blending at high-z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate mass halos hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos. Our method produces catalogs of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M|\Ngal,z), is characterized by a bimodal log-normal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor ~2 lower in mass.

It was proposed that the progenitor may have been a massive evolved star similar to eta Carinae, which resides in our own galaxy at a distance of about 2.3 kpc. eta Carinae appears ready to detonate.

If accreted on to larger haloes, tenuous dwarfs of this kind will be more susceptible to gas loss or tidal transformation than scaled-down versions of larger spirals.

Further observations using {\em   Swift}, Gemini-North, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory refined the source position and confirmed the absence of any optical counterpart to an X-ray to optical flux ratio of F_X/F_V > 8700 (3 sigma). Interpretation of 1RXS J141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dim isolated neutron star would place it at z ~ 5.1 kpc above the Galactic disk -- in the Galactic halo -- implying that it either has an extreme space velocity (v_z >~ 5100 km s-1) or has failed to cool according to theoretical predictions. Interpretations as a persistent anomalous X-ray pulsar, or a ``compact central object'' present conflicts with these classes' typical properties. We conclude the properties of Calvera are most consistent with those of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecond pulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm this classification.

We prove the density of algebraically closed geodesics on n-dimensional ellipsoids with respect to the natural topology in the (2n)-dimensional real parameter space. In particular, the approximating sequence of algebraic closed geodesics on the approximated ellipsoids may be chosen so to share the same values of the length and of the real period vector as the limiting closed geodesic on the limiting ellipsoid.   Finally, for real doubly-periodic geodesics on triaxial ellipsoids, we show how to evaluate algebraically the period mapping and we present some explicit examples of families of algebraically closed geodesics.",['nlin.SI']

Universal constraints on the xc energy are important ingredients in the construction of improved functionals. Here we investigate one such universal property of xc functionals: the Lieb-Oxford lower bound on the exchange-correlation energy, $E_{xc}[n] \ge -C \int d^3r n^{4/3}$, where $C\leq C_{LO}=1.68$. To this end, we perform a survey of available exact or near-exact data on xc energies of atoms, ions, molecules, solids, and some model Hamiltonians (the electron liquid, Hooke's atom and the Hubbard model). All physically realistic density distributions investigated are consistent with the tighter limit $C \leq 1$. For large classes of systems one can obtain class-specific (but not fully universal) similar bounds. The Lieb-Oxford bound with $C_{LO}=1.68$ is a key ingredient in the construction of modern xc functionals, and a substantial change in the prefactor $C$ will have consequences for the performance of these functionals.

If the magnetic axis is parallel to the rotation axis, the rotation does not affect the initial linear growth of the instability, but does restrict the growth of the instability outside of the equatorial zone.

705.4671,Rapid Diffusion of dipolar order enhances dynamic nuclear polarization,"  In a dynamic nuclear polarization experiment on a 40 mM solution of 4-amino-TEMPO in a 40:60 water/glycerol mixture, we have observed that the bulk dipolar reservoir is cooled to a spin temperature of 15.5 micro-K, following microwave irradiation for 800 s. This is significantly cooler than the 35 mK spin temperature of the Zeeman reservoir. Equilibration of the two reservoirs results in a 50 % increase in the NMR signal intensity, corresponding to a Zeeman spin temperature of 23 mK. In order to achieve this polarization directly, it was necessary to irradiate the sample with microwaves for 1500 s. Cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly communicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion is significantly faster than Zeeman spin diffusion, the bulk dipolar reservoir cools faster than the Zeeman reservoir. This process can be exploited to rapidly polarize the nuclear spins, by repeatedly cooling the dipolar system and transferring the polarization to the Zeeman reservoir.

705.0084,Dynamical Friction of a Circular-Orbit Perturber in a Gaseous Medium,"  We investigate the gravitational wake due to, and dynamical friction on, a perturber moving on a circular orbit in a uniform gaseous medium using a semi-analytic method. This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker (1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbit causes the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit, forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving rise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial) directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not contribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with a weak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit the front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is remarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the other hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly multiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail surrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed density at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide the fitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whose azimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula, provided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of the perturber, respectively.

Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources.

705.0107,Sterile neutrino oscillations after first MiniBooNE results,"  In view of the recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment we revisit the global neutrino oscillation fit to short-baseline neutrino data by adding one or two sterile neutrinos with eV-scale masses to the three Standard Model neutrinos, and for the first time we consider also the global fit with three sterile neutrinos. Four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type have been only marginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, and become even more disfavored with the new data (at the level of $4\sigma$). In the framework of so-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between appearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than $3\sigma$, and hence no satistfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes.

In view of the recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment we revisit the global neutrino oscillation fit to short-baseline neutrino data by adding one or two sterile neutrinos with eV-scale masses to the three Standard Model neutrinos, and for the first time we consider also the global fit with three sterile neutrinos. Four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type have been only marginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, and become even more disfavored with the new data (at the level of $4\sigma$). In the framework of so-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between appearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than $3\sigma$, and hence no satistfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes.

705.4541,Cosmic rays and the primordial gas,"  One of the most outstanding problems in the gravitational collapse scenario of early structure formation is the cooling of primordial gas to allow for small mass objects to form. As the neutral primordial gas is a poor radiator at temperatures (T\le10^4\unit{K}), molecular hydrogen is needed for further cooling down to temperatures (T\sim100\unit{K}). The formation of molecular hydrogen is catalyzed by the presence of free electrons, which could be provided by the ionization due to an early population of cosmic rays. In order to investigate this possibility we developed a code to study the effects of ionizing cosmic rays on the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas.

705.1593,Electrical transport and optical studies of ferromagnetic Cobalt doped   ZnO nanoparticles exhibiting a metal-insulator transition,"  The observed correlation of oxygen vacancies and room temperature ferromagnetic ordering in Co doped ZnO1-o nanoparticles reported earlier (Naeem et al Nanotechnology 17, 2675-2680) has been further explored by transport and optical measurements. In these particles room temperature ferromagnetic ordering had been observed to occur only after annealing in forming gas. In the current work the optical properties have been studied by diffuse reflection spectroscopy in the UV-Vis region and the band gap of the Co doped compositions has been found to decrease with Co addition. Reflections minima are observed at the energies characteristic of Co+2 d-d (tethrahedral symmetry) crystal field transitions, further establishing the presence of Co in substitutional sites. Electrical transport measurements on palletized samples of the nanoparticles show that the effect of a forming gas is to strongly decrease the resistivity with increasing Co concentration. For the air annealed and non-ferromagnetic samples the variation in the resistivity as a function of Co content are opposite to those observed in the particles prepared in forming gas.

The Assembly History of the Stellar Mass in   Galaxies: from the Young to the Old Universe,"  We present a detailed analysis of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function of galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VVDS. We estimate the stellar mass from broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star formation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%) stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3). In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more significantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to z=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for M>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution (`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible (<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded.

The most important example is the detection problem of selecting between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics, and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection. Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable frequency evolution.

704.3945,Extra energy coupling through subwavelength hole arrays via stochastic   resonance,"  Interaction between metal surface waves and periodic geometry of subwavelength structures is at the core of the recent but crucial renewal of interest in plasmonics. One of the most intriguing points is the observation of abnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which can exceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the filling factor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmission arises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission should disappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupled through the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise to the position of the apertures.

",cond-mat.other physics.optics,"Extra energy coupling through subwavelength hole arrays via stochastic   resonance.   Interaction between metal surface waves and periodic geometry of subwavelength structures is at the core of the recent but crucial renewal of interest in plasmonics. One of the most intriguing points is the observation of abnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which can exceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the filling factor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmission arises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission should disappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupled through the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise to the position of the apertures. This result can be modelled in the statistical framework of stochastic resonance.

In addition, we validate our results against simulations with N=19661 that include a mass spectrum with a turn-off mass at 0.8 M_{sun}, appropriate to describe the old stellar populations of galactic globular clusters.

In the brane world scenario, the four dimensional effective Einstein equation acquire extra terms, called dark radiation and dark pressure, respectively, which arise from the embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk.

This allows us to obtain the explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and the equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation. The physical and geometrical quantities are expressed in terms of observable/measurable parameters, like the tangential velocity, the baryonic mass and the radius of the galaxy.

704.3257,Millimeter dust continuum emission unveiling the true mass of giant   molecular clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"  CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in external galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely underestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity) than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support.

704.0758,Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement,"  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6], but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources, as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased, exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled photons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common past[1,2].

705.3611,Evidence for a jet contribution to the optical/infrared light of neutron   star X-ray binaries,"  Optical/near-infrared (optical/NIR; OIR) light from low-mass neutron star X-ray binaries (NSXBs) in outburst is traditionally thought to be thermal emission from the accretion disc. Here we present a comprehensive collection of quasi-simultaneous OIR and X-ray data from 19 low-magnetic field NSXBs, including new observations of three sources: 4U 0614+09, LMC X-2 and GX 349+2. The average radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where L_nu propto nu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. This is comparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for black hole X-ray binaries. The OIR spectra and relations between OIR and X-ray fluxes are compared to those expected if the OIR emission is dominated by thermal emission from an X-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission from the inner regions of the jets. We find that thermal emission due to X-ray reprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for some NSXBs, namely the atolls and millisecond X-ray pulsars (MSXPs). Optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets (with an observed OIR spectral index of alpha_thin < 0) dominate the NIR light above L_x ~ 10^36 erg/s and the optical above L_x ~ 10^37 erg/s in these systems.

We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma proposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to Cowie & McKee in regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

705.1023,Angles Between Infinite Dimensional Subspaces with Applications to the   Rayleigh-Ritz and Alternating Projectors Methods,"  We define angles from-to and between infinite dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space, inspired by the work of E. J. Hannan, 1961/1962 for general canonical correlations of stochastic processes. The spectral theory of selfadjoint operators is used to investigate the properties of the angles, e.g., to establish connections between the angles corresponding to orthogonal complements. The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are characterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant subspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the polar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors. Point angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles corresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former subspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter subspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff distance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces, is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces. We prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared. Finally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose its ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach. The corresponding convergence rate estimate is obtained in terms of the angles.

On the basis of the single-channel Hamiltonian, we perform full numerical calculations of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation coupled with the regularized gap and number equations. The zero-temperature phase diagram in the crossover regime is presented, where the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing state governs the weak-coupling BCS region of a resonance. It is found that the FFLO oscillation vanishes in the BEC side, in which the system under population imbalance turns into a phase separation (PS) between locally binding superfluid and fully polarized spin domains. We also demonstrate numerical calculations with a large particle number O(10^5), comparable to that observed in recent experiments. The resulting density profile on a resonance yields the PS, which is in good agreement with the recent experiments, while the FFLO modulation exists in the pairing field. It is also proposed that the most favorable location for the detection of the FFLO oscillation is in the vicinity of the critical population imbalance in the weak coupling BCS regime, where the oscillation periodicity becomes much larger than the interparticle spacing.

These observations are combined with CO J=3-2, HCN J=4-3 (this work), and CO J=2-1, J=1-0, 13CO J=2-1, HCN J=1-0 measurements taken from the literature to provide better constraints on the properties of the molecular gas in an extreme starburst/QSO in the local Universe. We find that the CO J=4-3 and J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower three CO transitions, with n(H_2) ~ (1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk ~ (40-70) K. This phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2 gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies, and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions.

706.1272,Grain Retention and Formation of Planetesimals near the Snow Line in   MRI-driven Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks,"  The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.

704.0773,Collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market,"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices. By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that, the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE. We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics with a two-factor model.

Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion.

These solutions are uniquely determined by a coloring of a 2-plane, which was argued to correspond to the phase space of free fermions. We show that in general this phase space distribution does not determine fully the 1/2 BPS state of N=4 SYM that the gravitational solution is dual to, but it does determine it enough so that vevs of all single trace 1/2 BPS operators in that state are uniquely determined to leading order in the large N limit. These are precisely the vevs encoded in the asymptotics of the LLM solutions. We extract these vevs for operators up to dimension 4 using holographic renormalization and KK holography and show exact agreement with the field theory expressions.

We mapped the largest areas in each cloud at millimeter or submillimeter wavelengths to date: 7.5 sq. deg in Perseus (Paper I), 10.8 sq. deg in Ophiuchus (Paper II), and 1.5 sq. deg in Serpens with a resolution of 31"", detecting 122, 44, and 35 cores, respectively. Here we report on results of the Serpens survey and compare the three clouds. Average measured angular core sizes and their dependence on resolution suggest that many of the observed sources are consistent with power-law density profiles. Tests of the effects of cloud distance reveal that linear resolution strongly affects measured source sizes and densities, but not the shape of the mass distribution. Core mass distribution slopes in Perseus and Ophiuchus (alpha=2.1+/-0.1 and alpha=2.1+/-0.3) are consistent with recent measurements of the stellar IMF, whereas the Serpens distribution is flatter (alpha=1.6+/-0.2). We also compare the relative mass distribution shapes to predictions from turbulent fragmentation simulations. Dense cores constitute less than 10% of the total cloud mass in all three clouds, consistent with other measurements of low star-formation efficiencies. Furthermore, most cores are found at high column densities; more than 75% of 1.1 mm cores are associated with Av>8 mag in Perseus, 15 mag in Serpens, and 20-23 mag in Ophiuchus.

The relative age and metallicity sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J, H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty parameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89 Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties in colours.

For this purpose, we use the teleparallel versions of Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann and M$\ddot{o}$ller prescriptions. A comparison of the results shows that the energy density is different but the momentum turns out to be constant in each prescription.

705.1734,Itinerant to localized transition of f electrons in antiferromagnetic   superconductor UPd2Al3,"  Electrons in solids have been conventionally classified as either band-like itinerant ones or atomic-like localized ones depending on their properties. For heavy Fermion (HF) compounds, however, the f electrons show both itinerant and localized behaviours depending on temperature. Above the characteristic temperature T*, which is typically of the order of few K to few tens K, their magnetic properties are well described by the ionic f-electron models, suggesting that the f-electrons behave as 'localized' electrons. On the other hand, well below T*, their Fermi surfaces (FS's) have been observed by magneto-oscillatory techniques, and generally they can be explained well by the 'itinerant' f-electron model. These two models assume totally different natures of felectrons, and how they transform between localized and itinerant state as a function of temperatures has never been understood on the level of their electronic structures. Here we have studied the band structure of the HF antiferromagnetic superconductor UPd2Al3 well below and above T* by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and revealed the temperature dependence of the electronic structure. We have found that the f-bands, which form the FS's at low temperatures are excluded from FS's at high temperatures.

In this paper we investigate the bias associated to the measure of the temperature from an X-ray thermal spectrum. We show that, in the case of low surface brightness regions, commonly adopted estimators, such as those based on chi squared and Cash statistics, return strongly biased results. We stress that this can have strong implications when measuring the temperature of cluster outer regions with current experiments. We consider various approaches to overcome this problem, the most effective is a technique which allows us to correct the bias a posteriori. Extensive montecarlo simulations show that our correction returns excellent results under different conditions.

704.2233,Bubbling AdS and droplet descriptions of BPS geometries in IIB   supergravity,"  This paper focuses on supergravity duals of BPS states in N=4 super Yang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of breathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1, and finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry analysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in the last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which have an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are determined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base. Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a four-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear, Monge-Ampere type equation.   Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS description of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which ensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle shrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional base. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a smooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the base. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an S^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including topology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from the base. In the case of 1/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularity conditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional base which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from those where the S^1 shrinks.

706.05,A deeper search for the progenitor of the Type Ic Supernova 2002ap,"  (Abridged) We present a search for the progenitor star of the Type Ic Supernova 2002ap in deep, high quality pre-explosion observations taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Aligning high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the supernova itself with the archival CFHT images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on the ground based observations. We find that a source visible in the B and R band pre-explosion images close to the position of the SN is (1) not coincident with the SN position within the uncertainties of our relative astrometry, and (2) is still visible ~ 4.7 yrs post-explosion in late-time observations taken with the William Herschel Telescope. We therefore conclude that it is not the progenitor of SN 2002ap. Comparing our luminosity limits with stellar models of single stars at appropriate metallicity (Z=0.008) we conclude that any single star progenitor must have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rates during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially > 30-40M(Sun) and exploded as a Wolf-Rayet star of final mass 10-12M(Sun). Alternatively an initially less massive progenitor may have evolved in an interacting binary system. We constrain any possible binary companion to a main sequence star of < 20M(Sun), a neutron star or a black hole. By combining the pre-explosion limits with the ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations we conclude that any binary interaction most likely occurred as Case B mass transfer, either with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.

705.2818,Quantum Theory of Flicker Noise in Metal Films,"  Flicker (1/f^gamma) voltage noise spectrum is derived from finite-temperature quantum electromagnetic fluctuations produced by elementary charge carriers in external electric field. It is suggested that deviations of the frequency exponent \gamma from unity, observed in thin metal films, can be attributed to quantum backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating field of the charge carrier. This backreaction is described phenomenologically in terms of the effective momentum space dimensionality, D. Using the dimensional continuation technique, it is shown that the combined action of the photon heat bath and external field results in a 1/f^gamma-contribution to the spectral density of the two-point correlation function of electromagnetic field. The frequency exponent is found to be equal to 1 + delta, where delta = 3 - D is a reduction of the momentum space dimensionality. This result is applied to the case of a biased conducting sample, and a general expression for the voltage power spectrum is obtained which possesses all characteristic properties of observed flicker noise spectra. The range of validity of this expression covers well the whole measured frequency band. Gauge independence of the power spectrum is proved.

In this report, we summarize the present experimental status and provide an up-to-date accounting of the standard model theory, including the expectations for improvement in the hadronic contributions, which dominate the overall uncertainty. Our primary focus is on the physics case that motivates improved experimental and theoretical efforts. Accordingly, we give examples of specific new-physics implications in the context of direct searches at the LHC as well as general arguments about the role of an improved (g-2) measurement. A brief summary of the plans for an upgraded effort complete the report.","['hep-ph', 'hep-ex']"

Our analysis of the differential cross section and spin-density matrix elements shows that the existing data may be understood on the base of conventional dynamics. For a firm conclusion about a possible manifestation of exotic channels one has to improve the resolution of the data with providing additional information on channels with spin- and double-spin flip transitions being sensitive to the properties of the photoproduction amplitude in $\gamma p$ and $\gamma D$ reactions. ,nucl-th,Photoproduction of phi meson off deuteron near threshold.

There is a fundamental incompatibility between model fits to X-ray surface brightness profiles and those done with SZE profiles.

705.0016,A Covariant Holographic Entanglement Entropy Proposal,"  With an aim towards understanding the time-dependence of entanglement entropy in generic quantum field theories, we propose a covariant generalization of the holographic entanglement entropy proposal of hep-th/0603001. Apart from providing several examples of possible covariant generalizations, we study a particular construction based on light-sheets, motivated in similar spirit to the covariant entropy bound underlying the holographic principle. In particular, we argue that the entanglement entropy associated with a specified region on the boundary in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is given by the area of a co-dimension two bulk surface with vanishing expansions of null geodesics. We demonstrate our construction with several examples to illustrate its reduction to the holographic entanglement entropy proposal in static spacetimes. We further show how this proposal may be used to understand the time evolution of entanglement entropy in a time varying QFT state dual to a collapsing black hole background.

Incorporating prior knowledge into the spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral peak energy $E_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\rm iso}$ (1--$10^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog, analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find that the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the Swift sample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with the best-fit pre-Swift relation at >5 sigma significance. Moreover, it has a factor >~ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $E_{\rm pk,obs}$. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partial correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al.

704.2175,Statistical properties of dust far-infrared emission,"  The description of the statistical properties of dust emission gives important constraints on the physics of the interstellar medium but it is also a useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission in the cases where it is considered a nuisance. The main goals of this analysis of the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are 1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in three dimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise due to dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproduce the observed statistical properties. The main results are the following. 1) The cirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously overestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where <I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in accordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a given angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing amplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust emission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average but shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have systematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and kurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong non-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power spectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function of wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification of Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.

We do so for systems with infinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so that the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric loop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system.

706.0344,Collisional processes and size distribution in spatially extended debris   discs,"  We present a new multi-annulus code for the study of collisionally evolving extended debris discs. We first aim to confirm results obtained for a single-annulus system, namely that the size distribution in ""real"" debris discs always departs from the theoretical collisional equilibrium $dN\proptoR^{-3.5}dR$ power law, especially in the crucial size range of observable particles (<1cm), where it displays a characteristic wavy pattern. We also aim at studying how debris discs density distributions, scattered light luminosity profiles, and SEDs are affected by the coupled effect of collisions and radial mixing due to radiation pressure affected small grains. The size distribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized bodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation pressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a fiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in $\Sigma(a)\propto a^{\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays a crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust is imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further inside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from the initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's mass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the scattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we propose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent bodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the collisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for future debris disc modeling.

705.1189,Hot Nights on Extrasolar Planets: Mid-IR Phase Variations of Hot   Jupiters,"  We present results from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the mid-infrared phase variations of three short-period extrasolar planetary systems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We gathered IRAC images in multiple wavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty in relative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger than the photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place 2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths. At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to the photon counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is in phase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of 0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it must recirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the 1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation).

The uncorrelated and correlated two-pion mechanisms change the rates moderately, thus maintaining the agreement with experiment. The modification in the strength and sign of some decay amplitudes becomes crucial and produces asymmetry parameters which lie well within the experimental observations.",['nucl-th']
705.3776,The photospheric environment of a solar pore with light bridge,"  Pores are one of the various features forming in the photosphere by the emergence of magnetic field onto the solar surface. They lie at the border between tiny magnetic elements and larger sunspots. Light bridges, in such structures, are bright features separating umbral areas in two or more irregular regions. Commonly, light bridges indicate that a the merging of magnetic regions or, conversely, the breakup of the area is underway. We investigate the velocity structure of a solar pore (AR10812) with light bridge, and of the quiet solar photosphere nearby, analyzing high spatial and spectral resolution images. The pore area has been observed with the Interferometric BI-dimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope, acquiring monochromatic images in the Ca II 854.2 nm line and in the Fe I 709.0 nm line as well as G-band and broad-band images. We also computed the Line of Sight (LoS) velocity field associated to the Fe I and Fe II photospheric lines. The amplitude of the LoS velocity fluctuations, inside the pore, is smaller than that observed in the quiet granulation near the active region. We computed the azimuthal average LoS velocity and derived its radial profile. The whole pore is characterized by a downward velocity -200 m/s and by an annular downflow structure with an average velocity of -350 m/s with respect to the nearby quiet sun. The light bridge inside the pore, when observed in the broad-band channel of IBIS and in the red wing of Ca II 854.2 nm line, shows an elongated dark structure running along its axis, that we explain with a semi-analytical model. In the highest resolution LoS velocity images the light bridge shows a profile consistent with a convective roll: a weak upflow, 50-100m/s, in correspondence of the dark lane, flanked by a downflow, -(200-300) m/s.

705.0165,Is Modified Gravity Required by Observations? An Empirical Consistency   Test of Dark Energy Models,"  We apply the technique of parameter-splitting to existing cosmological data sets, to check for a generic failure of dark energy models. Given a dark energy parameter, such as the energy density Omega_Lambda or equation of state w, we split it into two meta-parameters with one controlling geometrical distances, and the other controlling the growth of structure. Observational data spanning Type Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering, and weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two meta-parameters to be equal. This technique checks for inconsistency between different data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one data set (e.g., CMB or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry and growth. We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with current data. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growth and geometry that is different from that of general relativity. Parameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space of such theories. Our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limits on these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain the difference Omega_Lambda(geom) - Omega_Lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +/- 0.0058 (68% C.L.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) - w(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +/- 0.37 (68% C.L.). Interestingly, the region w(grow) > w(geom), which should be generically favored by theories that slow structure formation relative to general relativity, is quite restricted by data already.

705.1045,Conjectures on exact solution of three - dimensional (3D) simple   orthorhombic Ising lattices,"  We report the conjectures on the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model on simple orthorhombic lattices, together with the details of calculations for a putative exact solution. Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up dimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed to serve as a boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3D Ising model. The partition function of the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluated by spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity of the conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Ising lattices could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' or sinh 2K sinh 2(K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, the critical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratio xc = exp(-2Kc) = (sq(5) - 1)/2, as derived from K* = 3K or sinh 2K sinh 6K = 1. If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombic Ising system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of the phase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation functions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly. The putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple orthorhombic Ising lattices are alpha = 0, beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4, delta = 13/3, eta = 1/8 and nu = 2/3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scaling laws. The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and the results obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of the approximation methods and the experimental findings.

The aim is to derive the cluster membership, velocity and metallicity, and discuss recent claims in the literature (Tadross 2005) that NGC 1883 is as metal poor as globular clusters in the Halo. Besides, being one of the few outer Galactic disk intermediate-age open clusters known so far, it is an ideal target to improve our knowledge of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient, that is a basic ingredient for any chemical evolution model of the Milky Way. The new data we obtained allow us to put NGC 1883's basic parameters more reliable. We find that the cluster has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.20$\pm$0.22, from which we infer an age (650$^{+70}_{-70}$ Myr) close to the Hyades one and a Galactocentric distance of 12.3$^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ kpc.

704.0084,Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely   cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions,"  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

704.008,Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical   Evaporation,"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range).

In the slave-boson theory, the nodal quasiparticle current renormalization factor $\alpha$ vanishes proportionally to the zero temperature superfluid density $\rho_S(0)$; however, we find that away from the $\rho_S(0) \to 0$ limit $\alpha$ displays a much weaker doping dependence than $\rho_S(0)$. A similar conclusion applies to the doped-carrier theory, which differentiates the nodal and antinodal regions of momentum space. Due to its momentum space anisotropy, the doped-carrier theory enhances the value of $\alpha$ in the hole doped regime, bringing it to quantitative agreement with experiments, and reproduces the asymmetry between hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors.

705.1046,"Determination of the size, mass, and density of ""exomoons"" from   photometric transit timing variations","  Precise photometric measurements of the upcoming space missions allow the size, mass, and density of satellites of exoplanets to be determined. Here we present such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation ($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planet and its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit that is equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the barycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact value of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of the satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a reliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and the mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible in the case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratio cannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equal densities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of the satellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon system in front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020 Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result is comparable to the real values within a factor of 2.

These distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence, using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the substrate.

Under optimum conditions, fidelities of up to 0.99 for beam splitting and 0.98 for reflection are observed, and splitting operations of up to third order are achieved. The dependence of the operations on light intensity and atomic velocity is measured and found to agree well with theoretical estimates.",['cond-mat.other']
705.3856,Gamma-ray albedo of the moon,"  We use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo framework to calculate the gamma-ray albedo of the Moon due to interactions of cosmic ray (CR) nuclei with moon rock. Our calculation of the albedo spectrum agrees with the EGRET data. We show that the spectrum of gamma rays from the Moon is very steep with an effective cutoff around 4 GeV (600 MeV for the inner part of the Moon disc). Apart from other astrophysical sources, the albedo spectrum of the Moon is well understood, including its absolute normalisation; this makes it a useful ""standard candle"" for gamma-ray telescopes, such as the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). The albedo flux depends on the incident CR spectrum which changes over the solar cycle. Therefore, it is possible to monitor the CR spectrum using the albedo gamma-ray flux. Simultaneous measurements of CR proton and helium spectra by the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA), and observations of the albedo gamma rays by the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT), can be used to test the model predictions and will enable the GLAST LAT to monitor the CR spectrum near the Earth beyond the lifetime of PAMELA.

706.0705,On the dimension of subspaces with bounded Schmidt rank,"  We consider the question of how large a subspace of a given bipartite quantum system can be when the subspace contains only highly entangled states. This is motivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x d--dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2, all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r, the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing only states with Schmidt equal to r. ",quant-ph,"On the dimension of subspaces with bounded Schmidt rank.

705.1072,Precise measurements of radio-frequency magnetic susceptibility in   (anti)ferromagnetic materials,"  Dynamic magnetic susceptibility, $\chi$, was studied in several intermetallic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions. Precise measurements by using a 14 MHz tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) allow detailed insight into the field and temperature dependence of $\chi$. In particular, local moment ferromagnets show a sharp peak in $\chi(T)$ near the Curie temperature, $T_c$. The peak amplitude decreases and shifts to higher temperatures with very small applied dc fields. Anisotropic measurements of CeVSb$_3$ show that this peak is present provided the magnetic easy axis is aligned with the excitation field. In a striking contrast, small moment, itinerant ferromagnets (i.e., ZrZn$_2$) show a broad maximum in $\chi(T)$ that responds differently to applied field. We believe that TDO measurements provide a very sensitive way to distinguish between local and itinerant moment magnetic orders. Local moment antiferromagnets do not show a peak at the N\'eel temperature, $T_N$, but only a sharp decrease of $\chi$ below $T_N$ due to the loss of spin-disorder scattering changing the penetration depth of the ac excitation field. Furthermore, we show that the TDO is capable of detecting changes in spin order as well as metamagnetic transitions.

705.3525,"Comment on ""Minimal size of a barchan dune""","  It is now an accepted fact that the size at which dunes form from a flat sand bed as well as their `minimal size' scales on the flux saturation length. This length is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward equilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann [Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases to zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We first show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the relaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero. A key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the typical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the scaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and Andreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that Martian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the past under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated from thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic photographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size of 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at millimetre scale.

To capture this shape persistence, we define the local tangent field and study the two-time tangent-tangent correlation function, which exhibits a glass-like behavior.

A real circle can be defined as the image of the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise, and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the ${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension $\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation $\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.

705.3039,Massive planet migration: Theoretical predictions and comparison with   observations,"  We quantify the utility of large radial velocity surveys for constraining theoretical models of Type II migration and protoplanetary disk physics. We describe a theoretical model for the expected radial distribution of extrasolar planets that combines an analytic description of migration with an empirically calibrated disk model. The disk model includes viscous evolution and mass loss via photoevaporation. Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly selected subsample of planets from the Lick / Keck / AAT planet search programs, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk at a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription, and become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the radial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet masses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by existing data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample of planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model predicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of orbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet population. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon the adopted disk model. We find that the distribution can constrain not only changes in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, but also sharp jumps in the efficiency of angular momentum transport that might occur at small radii.

Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly selected subsample of planets from the Lick / Keck / AAT planet search programs, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk at a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription, and become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the radial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet masses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by existing data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample of planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model predicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of orbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet population. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon the adopted disk model. We find that the distribution can constrain not only changes in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, but also sharp jumps in the efficiency of angular momentum transport that might occur at small radii.",['astro-ph']

As the container acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean square particle displacement increase, gradually fluidizing the layer. For nearly elastic particles, or low shaking frequencies, or small layer depths, the end of the fluidization process is marked by an abrupt increase in the granular temperature and rms particle displacement. The layer is then fully fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations. Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts the change to lower accelerations.

705.4554,On The Stability of Non-Supersymmetric Attractors in String Theory,"  We study non-supersymmetric attractors obtained in Type IIA compactifications on Calabi Yau manifolds. Determining if an attractor is stable or unstable requires an algebraically complicated analysis in general. We show using group theoretic techniques that this analysis can be considerably simplified and can be reduced to solving a simple example like the STU model. For attractors with D0-D4 brane charges, determining stability requires expanding the effective potential to quartic order in the massless fields. We obtain the full set of these terms. For attractors with D0-D6 brane charges, we find that there is a moduli space of solutions and the resulting attractors are stable. Our analysis is restricted to the two derivative action.

704.2249,Dust Formation and He II 4686 emission in the Dense Shell of the   Peculiar Type Ib Supernova 2006jc,"  We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN based on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an LBV-like outburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key evidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum source fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d after peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding SN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by extremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced X-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this object was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most peculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment created by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.

704.1668,A new search for planet transits in NGC 6791,"  Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.   Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched for close-in planets using the transit technique.   Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\'artir telescope (2.1m), and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary transits was achieved.   Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791 be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.   Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include: (i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii) limitations in the basic assumptions.

704.375,Thermal Effects of Rotation in Random Classical Zero-Point Radiation,"  The rotating reference system, two-point correlation functions, and energy density are used as the basis for investigating thermal effects observed by a detector rotating through random classical zero-point radiation. The RS consists of Frenet -Serret orthogonal tetrads where the rotating detector is at rest and has a constant acceleration vector. The CFs and the energy density at the rotating reference system should be periodic with rotation period because CF and energy density measurements is one of the tools the detector can use to justify the periodicity of its motion. The CFs have been calculated for both electromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without taking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic CFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the temperature T= h w /k . Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic and massless scalar field it is shown that the detector rotating in the zero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but, above that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial detector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T. This effect is masked by factor 2/3(4 gamma^2-1) for the electromagnetic field and 2/9 (4 gamma ^2-1) for the massless scalar field, where the Lorentz factor gamma=(1 - v^2 / c^2)^(1/2). Appearance of these masking factors is connected with the fact that rotation is defined by two parameters, angular velocity w and the radius of rotation, in contrast with a uniformly accelerated linear motion which is defined by only one parameter, acceleration a.

In this paper, the third of the series, we report the results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources, 50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50 new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects.

The host galaxy shows HII region lines at redshift of z=0.0574, which puts the peak unfiltered absolute magnitude at a somewhat over-luminous -19.6. The spectra show weak and narrow SiII lines, and for a period of at least 10 days beginning around maximum light these profiles do not change in width or depth and they indicate a constant expansion velocity of ~10,600 km/s. We analyzed the observations based on detailed radiation dynamical models in the literature. Whereas delayed detonation and deflagration models have been used to explain the majority of SNe Ia, they do not predict a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an unvarying line profile. Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form shell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the shell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII line evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and other possibilities may exist. SN 2005hj is consistent with respect to the onset, duration, and velocity of the plateau, the peak luminosity and, within the uncertainties, with the intrinsic colors for models with M_shell=0.2 M_sun. Our analysis suggests a distinct class of events hidden within the Branch-normal SNe Ia. If the predicted relations between observables are confirmed, they may provide a way to separate these two groups. We discuss the implications of two distinct progenitor classes on cosmological studies employing SNe Ia, including possible differences in the peak luminosity to light curve width relation.

The intermediate states for the Raman transition are the vibrational levels of a third microtrap, and we determine the experimental conditions for which the overlap of the wave functions leads to an efficient transfer. There is a close analogy with the Franck-Condon principle in the spectroscopy of molecules. Spin-dependent manipulation of neutral atoms in microtraps has important applications in quantum information processing.

705.2166,Ultimate Fate of our Universe from Quantum Mechanics,"  It is conjectured that time intervals of any kind are proportional to the age of the Universe taken at the time we are considering the interval. If this is the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is confirmed.

704.3813,The Curious Case of NGC6908,"  The object NGC6908 was once thought to be simply a surface-brightness enhancement in the eastern spiral arm of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC6907. Based on an examination of near-infrared imaging, the object is shown in fact to be a lenticular S0(6/7) galaxy hidden in the optical glare of the disk and spiral structure of the larger galaxy. New radial velocities of NGC6908 (3,060+/-16 (emission); 3,113+/-73 km/s (absorption)) have been obtained at the Baade 6.5m and the duPont 2.5m telescopes at Las Campanas, Chile placing NGC6908 at the same expansion-velocity distance as NGC6907 (3,190+/-5 km/s), eliminating the possibility of a purely chance line-of-sight coincidence. The once-enigmatic asymmetries in the disk and outer spiral structure of NGC6907 are now explained as being due to an advanced merger event. Newly discovered tails and debris in the outer reaches of this galaxy further support the merger scenario for this system. This pair of galaxies is a rather striking example of two objects discovered over 100 years ago, whose true nature was lost until modern detectors operating at infrared wavelengths gave us a new (high-contrast) look.

705.4221,Controllability of the heat and wave equations and their finite   difference approximations by the shape of the domain,"  In this article we study a controllability problem for a parabolic and a hyperbolic partial differential equations in which the control is the shape of the domain where the equation holds. The quantity to be controlled is the trace of the solution into an open subdomain and at a given time, when the right hand side source term is known. The mapping that associates this trace to the shape of the domain is nonlinear. We show (i) an approximate controllability property for the linearized parabolic problem and (ii) an exact local controllability property for the linearized and the nonlinear equations in the hyperbolic case. We then address the same questions in the context of a finite difference spatial semi-discretization in both the parabolic and hyperbolic problems. In this discretized case again we prove a local controllability result for the parabolic problem, and an exact controllability for the hyperbolic case, applying a local surjectivity theorem together with a unique continuation property of the underlying adjoint discrete system.

704.1799,Super Low Traction under EHD and Mixed Lubrication Regimes,"  After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e. fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above conditions.

706.0443,Conservation Laws and Potential Symmetries of Linear Parabolic Equations,"  We carry out an extensive investigation of conservation laws and potential symmetries for the class of linear (1+1)-dimensional second-order parabolic equations. The group classification of this class is revised by employing admissible transformations, the notion of normalized classes of differential equations and the adjoint variational principle. All possible potential conservation laws are described completely. They are in fact exhausted by local conservation laws. For any equation from the above class the characteristic space of local conservation laws is isomorphic to the solution set of the adjoint equation. Effective criteria for the existence of potential symmetries are proposed. Their proofs involve a rather intricate interplay between different representations of potential systems, the notion of a potential equation associated with a tuple of characteristics, prolongation of the equivalence group to the whole potential frame and application of multiple dual Darboux transformations. Based on the tools developed, a preliminary analysis of generalized potential symmetries is carried out and then applied to substantiate our construction of potential systems.

We carry out an extensive investigation of conservation laws and potential symmetries for the class of linear (1+1)-dimensional second-order parabolic equations. The group classification of this class is revised by employing admissible transformations, the notion of normalized classes of differential equations and the adjoint variational principle. All possible potential conservation laws are described completely. They are in fact exhausted by local conservation laws. For any equation from the above class the characteristic space of local conservation laws is isomorphic to the solution set of the adjoint equation. Effective criteria for the existence of potential symmetries are proposed. Their proofs involve a rather intricate interplay between different representations of potential systems, the notion of a potential equation associated with a tuple of characteristics, prolongation of the equivalence group to the whole potential frame and application of multiple dual Darboux transformations. Based on the tools developed, a preliminary analysis of generalized potential symmetries is carried out and then applied to substantiate our construction of potential systems. The simplest potential symmetries of the linear heat equation, which are associated with single conservation laws, are classified with respect to its point symmetry group.

705.1385,Bell inequalities for continuous-variable correlations,"  We derive a new class of correlation Bell-type inequalities. The inequalities are valid for any number of outcomes of two observables per each of n parties, including continuous and unbounded observables. We show that there are no first-moment correlation Bell inequalities for that scenario, but such inequalities can be found if one considers at least second moments. The derivation stems from a simple variance inequality by setting local commutators to zero. We show that above a constant detector efficiency threshold, the continuous variable Bell violation can survive even in the macroscopic limit of large n. This method can be used to derive other well-known Bell inequalities, shedding new light on the importance of non-commutativity for violations of local realism.

We show that the HPZ master equation for the reduced density matrix derived earlier [B.L. Hu, J.P. Paz, Y. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 45, 2843 (1992)] with coefficients obtained from solutions of integro-differential equations can assume closed functional forms for a fairly general class of spectral densities of the environment at arbitrary temperature and coupling strength. As an illustration of these new results we solve the corresponding master equation and calculate, among other physical quantities, the uncertainty function whose late time behavior can be obtained fully. This produces a formula for investigating the standard quantum limit which is central to addressing many theoretical issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena and experimental concerns related to low temperature precision measurements. We find that any initial state always settles down to a Gaussian density matrix whose covariance is determined by the thermal reservoir and whose mean is determined by the external force. For more general spectra we show that the solution of the master equation can be reduced to solving for the motion of a classical parametric oscillator with parametric frequency determined by the unsolved for master equation coefficients.

704.0259,Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects,"  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution.

The radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a semi-amplitude of 148.8 km/s and a period of 7.5936 hours, which implies a companion mass of M > 0.28Msun. The lack of evidence of a companion in the optical photometry forces any main-sequence companion to be smaller than 0.1Msun, hence a low mass main sequence star companion is ruled out for this system. The companion is most likely another white dwarf, and we present tentative evidence for an evolutionary scenario which could have produced it. However, a neutron star companion cannot be ruled out and follow-up radio observations are required to search for a pulsar companion.

The Casimir energy can be written as a sum over the modes of a real cavity and one may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution ""plasmonic"". We evaluate analytically the contribution of the plasmonic modes to the Casimir energy. Surprisingly we find that this becomes repulsive for intermediate and large mirror separations. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.

We detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards 17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all sources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and 2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections (young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect to current theories of massive star formation via accretion.

704.2333,Discrete Choices under Social Influence: Generic Properties,"  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary choice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay (IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support (compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the space of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are precisely delimited.

On the face of it these conditions appear rather different. We show, however, that in the semiclassical regime, in which the action of the system is large compared to $\hbar$, and the measurement noise is small, they both offer an essentially equivalent local picture. Within this regime, the weak conditions dominate while in the opposite regime where the action is not much larger than Planck's constant, the strong conditions dominate.

706.0406,Evolutionary dynamics of the most populated genotype on rugged fitness   landscapes,"  We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which are defined on the multi-dimensional genotypic space and have many local optima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population jumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation. This is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified version of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard Wright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and the shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of the two models are identical for questions related to the most populated genotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite populations some of which were obtained numerically in previous works.

We compare the properties of grouped and isolated galaxies in regions of different density in superclusters. We find that in high-density cores of rich superclusters there is an excess of early type, passive galaxies, among galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as among those which do not belong to groups, while in lower density outer regions there are more blue, star-forming galaxies both in groups and among those galaxies which do not belong to groups. This also shows that the galaxy content of groups depends on the environment where the groups reside in. The density distributions and the behaviour of the Minkowski functional V3 for different superclusters show that substructures in superclusters as traced by different populations of galaxies are very different.

We study two cases. In the first case, both phases are modeled as Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic materials. In the second case, one phase is a Kelvin-Voight material, and the other is a viscous Newtonian fluid. The microscale system contains the conservation of mass and balance of momentum equations. The inertial terms in the momentum equation incorporate the actual interface advected by the flow. In the constitutive equations, a frozen interface is employed. The interface geometry is arbitrary: we do not assume periodicity, statistical homogeneity or scale separation. The problem is homogenized using G-convergence and oscillating test functions. Since the microscale system is not parabolic, previously known constructions of the test functions do not work here. The test functions developed in the paper are non-local in time and satisfy divergence-free constraint exactly. The latter feature enables us to avoid working with pressure directly.

705.4012,Black Hole Evaporation in an Expanding Universe,"  We calculate the quantum radiation power of black holes which are asymptotic to the Einstein-de Sitter universe at spatial and null infinities. We consider two limiting mass accretion scenarios, no accretion and significant accretion. We find that the radiation power strongly depends on not only the asymptotic condition but also the mass accretion scenario. For the no accretion case, we consider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass resides in the dust Friedmann universe. We find negative cosmological correction besides the expected redshift factor. This is given in terms of the cubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so that it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M/10^{6}M_{\odot})^{1/3} (t/14 {Gyr})^{-1/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of primordial black holes. Due to the cosmological effects, this black hole has not settled down to an equilibrium state. This cosmological correction may be interpreted in an analogy with the radiation from a moving mirror in a flat spacetime. For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer solution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the cosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is apparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole of which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment. Hence, the energy loss rate decreases and tends to vanish as time proceeds. Consequently, the energy loss due to evaporation is insignificant compared to huge mass accretion onto the black hole.

705.0628,A Photoionization Model For The Soft X-Ray Spectrum Of NGC 4151,"  We present analysis of archival data from multiple XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Spectral data from the RGS instruments reveal several strong soft X-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like and helium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. Radiative recombination continua (RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that the emission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDY photoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column density model (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing all detected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-like triplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data were ignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux from intercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonance line data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only two components. We found that observed oxygen G and R ratios especially were anomalous in parameter space investigated. We investigated, and were forced to dismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could be responsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. We succeeded in modeling the observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density (10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high covering factor. While sufficient to reproduce observed soft X-ray flux, our model faces certain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the line profile.

However, despite decades of theoretical and observational work since their discovery, no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed X-ray spectra has emerged. In this paper, we report on a self-consistent calculation of the spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that includes an explicit treatment of the bulk and thermal Comptonization occurring in the radiation-dominated shocks that form in the accretion flows. Using a rigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation injected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent photon spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy exponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good agreement with the spectra of the bright pulsar Her X-1 and the low luminosity pulsar X Per.

Using a rigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation injected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent photon spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy exponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good agreement with the spectra of the bright pulsar Her X-1 and the low luminosity pulsar X Per.",['astro-ph']

706.088,On the X-Ray emission of Gamma Ray Bursts,"  Recent data gathered and triggered by the SWIFT satellite have greatly improved our knowledge of long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs). This is particularly the case for the X-ray data at all times. We show that the entire X-ray observations are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the `cannonball' model of GRBs and XRFs, which are based on simple physics and were published long before the launch of SWIFT. Two mechanisms underlie these predictions: inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation, generally dominant at early and late times, respectively. The former mechanism provides a unified description of the gamma-ray peaks, X-ray flares and even the optical `humps' seen in some favourable cases; i.e. their very different durations, fluxes and peak-times are related precisely as predicted. The observed smooth or bumpy fast decay of the X-ray light curve is correctly described case-by-case, in minute detail. The `canonical' X-ray plateau, as well as the subsequent gradual steepening of the afterglow to an asymptotic power-law decay, are as foretold.

705.3655,Evidence Of Dark Matter Annihilations In The WMAP Haze,"  The WMAP experiment has revealed an excess of microwave emission from the region around the center of our Galaxy. It has been suggested that this signal, known as the ``WMAP Haze'', could be synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons generated in dark matter annihilations. In this letter, we revisit this possibility. We find that the angular distribution of the WMAP Haze matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density profile, $\rho(r) \propto r^{-1.2}$ in the inner kiloparsecs. Comparing the intensity in different WMAP frequency bands, we find that a wide range of possible WIMP annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze for a WIMP with a mass in the 100 GeV to multi-TeV range. Most interestingly, we find that to generate the observed intensity of the haze, the dark matter annihilation cross section is required to be approximately equal to the value needed for a thermal relic, $\sigma v \sim 3 \times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s. No boost factors are required. If dark matter annihilations are in fact responsible for the WMAP Haze, and the slope of the halo profile continues into the inner Galaxy, GLAST is expected to detect gamma rays from the dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Center if the WIMP mass is less than several hundred GeV.

705.4196,The AU Microscopii Debris Disk: Multiwavelength Imaging and Modeling,"  (abridged) Debris disks around main sequence stars are produced by the erosion and evaporation of unseen parent bodies. AU Microscopii (GJ 803) is a compelling object to study in the context of disk evolution across different spectral types, as it is an M dwarf whose near edge-on disk may be directly compared to that of its A5V sibling beta Pic. We resolve the disk from 8-60 AU in the near-IR JHK' bands at high resolution with the Keck II telescope and adaptive optics, and develop a novel data reduction technique for the removal of the stellar point spread function. The point source detection sensitivity in the disk midplane is more than a magnitude less sensitive than regions away from the disk for some radii. We measure a blue color across the near-IR bands, and confirm the presence of substructure in the inner disk. Some of the structural features exhibit wavelength-dependent positions. The disk architecture and characteristics of grain composition are inferred through modeling. We approach the modeling of the dust distribution in a manner that complements previous work. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we compare a relatively simple model of the distribution of porous grains to a broad data set, simultaneously fitting to midplane surface brightness profiles and the spectral energy distribution. Our model confirms that the large-scale architecture of the disk is consistent with detailed models of steady-state grain dynamics. Here, a belt of parent bodies from 35-40 AU is responsible for producing dust that is then swept outward by the stellar wind and radiation pressures. We infer the presence of very small grains in the outer region, down to sizes of ~0.05 micron. These sizes are consistent with stellar mass-loss rates Mdot_* << 10^2 Mdot_sun.

Most of the detected line transitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing a comprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various line emissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass. A principal component analysis of the spectral line maps reveals that the observed emission lines fall into five distinct groups, each of which may exhibit a distinct spatial distribution: (1) lines of S and H2 (J > 2); (2) the H2 S(0) line; (3) lines of ions with appearance potentials less than 13.6 eV; (4) lines of ions with appearance potentials greater than 13.6 eV, not including S++; (5) lines of S++. Lines of group (1) likely originate in molecular material subject to a slow, nondissociative shock that is driven by the overpressure within the supernova remnant, and lines in groups (3) - (5) are associated primarily with dissociative shock fronts with a range of (larger) shock velocities.

In addition to these 25 spectral lines, the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.6 micron PAH emission bands were also observed. Most of the detected line transitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing a comprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various line emissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass. A principal component analysis of the spectral line maps reveals that the observed emission lines fall into five distinct groups, each of which may exhibit a distinct spatial distribution: (1) lines of S and H2 (J > 2); (2) the H2 S(0) line; (3) lines of ions with appearance potentials less than 13.6 eV; (4) lines of ions with appearance potentials greater than 13.6 eV, not including S++; (5) lines of S++. Lines of group (1) likely originate in molecular material subject to a slow, nondissociative shock that is driven by the overpressure within the supernova remnant, and lines in groups (3) - (5) are associated primarily with dissociative shock fronts with a range of (larger) shock velocities. The H2 S(0) line shows a low-density diffuse emission component, and - in some sources - a shock-excited component.",['astro-ph']

704.1507,HST/ACS Coronagraphic Observations of the Dust Surrounding HD 100546,"  We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103 pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta (F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed disk material.

First detection of SiI, CaI and FeI in a QSO absorber","  We present the observations of a weak MgII absorption system detected at z~0.452 in the UVES high resolution spectrum of the QSO HE0001-2340. The weaker of the two MgII components forming the system shows associated absorptions due to SiI, CaI and FeI observed for the first time in a QSO spectrum. We investigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those of different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of commonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average properties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows, in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results of photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV background. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density cannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex density structure for the absorber.

Firstly, an alignment analysis identifies two mean preferred planes in the sky, both with normal axes close to the CMB dipole axis. The first plane is defined by the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. A mean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to the ecliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalously avoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insight on recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006). Secondly, a signed-intensity analysis identifies three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemisphere with anomalously high or low temperature of local CMB features: a cold spot essentially identified with a known cold spot (Vielva et al. 2004), a second cold spot lying very close to the southern end of the CMB dipole axis, and a hot spot lying close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis. In both analyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significance levels around 1%.

The design maintains the advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity. Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy consumption.

From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340 globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation axis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the halo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial dependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12) Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and (1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius of 50 kpc.

704.0792,The Relationship Between Molecular Gas Tracers and Kennicutt-Schmidt   Laws,"  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density, depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al. hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

705.2559,Can quarkonia survive deconfinement ?,"  We study quarkonium correlators and spectral functions at zero and finite temperature in QCD with only heavy quarks using potential models combined with perturbative QCD. First, we show that this approach can describe the quarkonium correlation function at zero temperature. Using a class of screened potentials based on lattice calculations of the static quark-antiquark free energy we calculate spectral functions at finite temperature. We find that all quarkonium states, with the exception of the $1S$ bottomonium, dissolve in the deconfined phase at temperatures smaller than $1.5T_c$, in contradiction with the conclusions of recent studies. Despite this the temperature dependence of the quarkonium correlation functions calculated on the lattice is well reproduced in our model. We also find that even in the absence of resonances the spectral function at high temperatures is significantly enhanced over the spectral function corresponding to free quark antiquark propagation.

In this way, a combinatorial problem is feasible (e.g. a graph is 3-colorable, hamiltonian, etc.) if and only if a related system of polynomial equations has a solution. In the first part of this paper, we construct new polynomial encodings for the problems of finding in a graph its longest cycle, the largest planar subgraph, the edge-chromatic number, or the largest k-colorable subgraph.   For an infeasible polynomial system, the (complex) Hilbert Nullstellensatz gives a certificate that the associated combinatorial problem is infeasible. Thus, unless P = NP, there must exist an infinite sequence of infeasible instances of each hard combinatorial problem for which the minimum degree of a Hilbert Nullstellensatz certificate of the associated polynomial system grows.   We show that the minimum-degree of a Nullstellensatz certificate for the non-existence of a stable set of size greater than the stability number of the graph is the stability number of the graph.

704.3385,Constrained simulations of the local universe: I. Mass and motion in the   Local Volume,"  It has been recently claimed that there is no correlation between the distribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocities within the Local Volume (LV), namely a sphere of R=7/h Mpc around the Local Group (LG). It has been then stated that this implies that either locally dark matter is not distributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are not due to fluctuations in mass. To test that statement a set of constrained N-body cosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scale structure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within the flat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrained simulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed for comparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LG environment. The local gravitational field due to all halos found within each LV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in the simulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and the local gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos. Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiar velocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlation with peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocity with gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Upon considering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitational accelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatter independent on the cosmological models.

A string representation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective string representation of a Wilson Loop. The action obtained in this manner is invariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which contains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string interaction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy quark potential. On the other hand if an allowance is made for the finite intrinsic thickness of the flux-tube, by assuming that the spin-string interaction takes place not just at the boundary of the string world-sheet but extends to a distance of the order of the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube, then we do obtain a spin-spin interaction which falls as the fifth power of the distance.

705.0429,"Bayesian reconstruction of the cosmological large-scale structure:   methodology, inverse algorithms and numerical optimization","  We address the inverse problem of cosmic large-scale structure reconstruction from a Bayesian perspective. For a linear data model, a number of known and novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.

It is found that particles can diffuse between lattice sites, maintaining the lattice structure, through an activated hopping mechanism. This feature yields finite values for the diffusivity and full relaxation of density correlation functions. Simulations suggest the existence of a localization transition which is avoided by hopping, and a dynamic decoupling between self- and collective correlations.",['cond-mat.soft']

A detailed analysis gives for the magnetization exponent delta = 1.30 +/- 0.02 using lattice sizes up to 80x80; this is compatible with the droplet model prediction delta = 1.282. The reason for previous disagreements stems from the need to analyze both singular and analytic contributions in the low-field regime.",['cond-mat.dis-nn']
704.2985,Electronic structure of BaFeO3: an abinitio DFT study,"  First principles calculations were performed to study the ground state electronic properties of BaFeO3 (BFO) within the density functional theory (DFT). Adopting generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange and correlation functional and Vosko-Wilk-Nusair correlation energy functional interpolation, we have systematically conducted the band structure, density of states and electronic distribution along different crystalline planes. Calculating results show that band gap in the majority spin band structure and band gap in the minority spin band structure were found to be 2.7012 eV and 0.6867 eV respectively. Up-spin Fe t2g were fully occupied and down-spin Fe eg were empty. Moreover, the up-spin Fe eg and down-spin Fe t2g were partially occupied near the Fermi energy, leading to a finite density of states. The Fe4+-O-Fe4+ plane superexchange coupling should rearrange the magnetic order to make the ferromagnetic characteristic being possible, moreover the tetragonal displacement along the c axis could induce the perovskites materials to acquire ferroelectric property. These reasons could lead to the fact that the tetragonal phase BFO could be a potential multiferroics while it was produced under the very experimental conditions. The charge density along different crystalline planes were illustrated to show that strong covalent bonding between O and Fe can be used to investigate the exchange coupling, and this strong hybridization may further increase the superexchange coupling to enhance the magnetic ordering.

The energy of the fundamental harmonic of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux from the source (luminosity range 5x10^{37} - 2x10^{38} erg/s) is ~11 keV. When the pulsar luminosity falls below ~5x10^{37} erg/s, the energy of the fundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to ~16 keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this change in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the emitting region by ~2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity ~7x10^{37} erg/s, four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in the spectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates is compact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of the accretion column is uniform.

The frequency $\nu_m$ of the mass current is approximately given by the Kepler frequency, whereas the frequencies of $Q_i$ and $Q_o$, $\nu_i$ and $\nu_o$, respectively, are calculated from classical mechanics and Coulomb's law.   For the explanation of the low frequency QPOs in pulsars and black holes a special interpretation of the gravitomagnetic theory may be essential. From the latter theory four new gravitomagnetic precession frequencies are deduced, which may be identified with the observed low frequency QPOs.   Predictions of the presented model are compared with observed high frequency and low frequency QPOs of the pulsars SAX J1808.4--3658, XTE J1807--294, IGR J00291+5934, SGR 1806--20 and the black hole XTE J1550--564. In addition, charge flow near the pole of pulsars may explain frequency drift of burst oscillations. Moreover, charge flow at the equator of SAX J1808.4--3658 may be the cause of the enigmatic 410 kHz QPO. Furthermore, the Lense-Thirring frequency is discussed and a modified formula is compared with data of the pulsars.

706.0513,High resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of ultraluminous infrared   galaxies,"  (Abridged) We present R~600, 10-37um spectra of 53 ULIRGs at z<0.32, taken using the IRS on board Spitzer. All of the spectra show fine structure emission lines of Ne, O, S, Si and Ar, as well as molecular Hydrogen lines. Some ULIRGs also show emission lines of Cl, Fe, P, and atomic Hydrogen, and/or absorption features from C_2H_2, HCN, and OH. We employ diagnostics based on the fine-structure lines, as well as the EWs and luminosities of PAH features and the strength of the 9.7um silicate absorption feature (S_sil), to explore the power source behind the infrared emission in ULIRGs. We show that the IR emission from the majority of ULIRGs is powered mostly by star formation, with only ~20% of ULIRGs hosting an AGN with a comparable or greater IR luminosity than the starburst. The detection of the 14.32um [NeV] line in just under half the sample however implies that an AGN contributes significantly to the mid-IR flux in ~42% of ULIRGs. The emission line ratios, luminosities and PAH EWs are consistent with the starbursts and AGN in ULIRGs being more extincted, and for the starbursts more compact, versions of those in lower luminosity systems. The excitations and electron densities in the NLRs of ULIRGs appear comparable to those of lower luminosity starbursts, though there is evidence that the NLR gas in ULIRGs is more dense. We show that the combined luminosity of the 12.81um [NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines correlates with both IR luminosity and the luminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use this to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate. Finally, we show that ULIRGs with 0.8 < S_sil < 2.4 are likely to be powered mainly by star formation, but that ULIRGs with S_sil < 0.8, and possibly those with S_sil > 2.4, contain an IR-luminous AGN.

Below a critical field or a critical temperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand QMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates that there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations with increasing field or temperature.

A few such measurements toward the LMC/SMC would reveal the nature of the lenses being detected in this direction (dark halo objects, or ordinary LMC/SMC stars).

We present in detail a systematic expansion of the relevant magnetic RIXS cross section by using the ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) approximation. We compute the scattering intensity and its momentum dependence in leading order of the UCL expansion. The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and is calculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model for this compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions. We observe that the latter terms in the Hamiltonian enhance the first moment of the spectrum if they strengthen the antiferromagnetic ordering. The theoretical spectra agree very well with experimental data, including the observation that scattering intensity vanishes for the transferred momenta ${\bf q} = (0,0)$ and ${\bf q} = (\pi,\pi)$. We show that at finite temperature there is an additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid basis.

705.2339,A Massive Yang-Mills Theory based on the Nonlinearly Realized Gauge   Group,"  We propose a subtraction scheme for a massive Yang-Mills theory realized via a nonlinear representation of the gauge group (here SU(2)). It is based on the subtraction of the poles in D-4 of the amplitudes, in dimensional regularization, after a suitable normalization has been performed. Perturbation theory is in the number of loops and the procedure is stable under iterative subtraction of the poles. The unphysical Goldstone bosons, the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and the unphysical mode of the gauge field are expected to cancel out in the unitarity equation. The spontaneous symmetry breaking parameter is not a physical variable. We use the tools already tested in the nonlinear sigma model: hierarchy in the number of Goldstone boson legs and weak power-counting property (finite number of independent divergent amplitudes at each order). It is intriguing that the model is naturally based on the symmetry SU(2)_L local times SU(2)_R global. By construction the physical amplitudes depend on the mass and on the self-coupling constant of the gauge particle and moreover on the scale parameter of the radiative corrections.

705.0726,Diversity of Decline-Rate-Corrected Type Ia Supernova Rise Times: One   Mode or Two?,"  B-band light-curve rise times for eight unusually well-observed nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are fitted by a newly developed template-building algorithm, using light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions.   From the available literature, photometric BVRI data collected over many months, including the earliest points, are reconciled, combined, and fitted to a unique time of explosion for each SN. On average, after they are corrected for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81 +- 0.36 days, while five SNe rise in 16.64 +- 0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single parent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rms intrinsic scatter of the decline-rate-corrected SN rise time is 0.96 +0.52 -0.25 days -- a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding global mean rise time is 17.44 +- 0.39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated by intrinsic variance. This value is ~2 days shorter than two published averages that nominally are twice as precise, though also based on small samples. When comparing high-z to low-z SN luminosities for determining cosmological parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an unrealistic rise time.

The presence of magnetic fluxes on the brane world volume, required for chirality, perturb the soft terms away from those previously computed in the dilute-flux limit. We use the difference in high-scale gauge couplings to estimate the magnitude of this perturbation and study the potential effects of the magnetic fluxes by generating many random spectra with the soft terms perturbed around the dilute flux limit. Even with a 40% variation in the high-scale soft terms the low-energy spectra take a clear and predictive form. The resulting spectra are broadly similar to those arising on the SPS1a slope, but more degenerate. In their minimal version the models predict the ratios of gaugino masses to be M_1 : M_2 : M_3=(1.5 - 2) : 2 : 6, different to both mSUGRA and mirage mediation. Among the scalars, the squarks tend to be lighter and the sleptons heavier than for comparable mSUGRA models.

705.3989,Augmented Sparse Reconstruction of Protein Signaling Networks,"  The problem of reconstructing and identifying intracellular protein signaling and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade. More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions. Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.

705.2887,Exclusive photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in proton-proton and   proton-antiproton scattering,"  Protons and antiprotons at collider energies are a source of high energy Weizs\""acker--Williams photons. This may open a possibility to study exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons at energies much larger than possible at the HERA accelerator. Here we present a detailed investigation of the exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton (RHIC, LHC) and proton-antiproton (Tevatron) collisions. We calculate several differential distributions in $t_1, t_2, y, \phi$, as well as transverse momentum distributions of $J/\Psi$'s. We discuss correlations in the azimuthal angle between outgoing protons or proton and antiproton as well as in the ($t_1, t_2$) space. Differently from electroproduction experiments, here both colliding beam particles can be a source of photons, and we find large interference terms in azimuthal angle distributions in a broad range of rapidities of the produced meson. We also include the spin--flip parts in the electromagnetic vertices. We discuss the effect of absorptive corrections on various distributions. Interestingly, absorption corrections induce a charge asymmetry in rapidity distributions, and are larger for $p p$ reactions than for the $p \bar p$ case. The reaction considered here constitutes an important nonreduceable background in recently proposed searches for odderon exchange.

This interesting result arises from an analysis employing the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit states.

We show that this model exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

706.0517,TeV gamma-rays from photo-disintegration/de-excitation of nuclei in   Westerlund 2,"  TeV gamma-rays can result from the photo-de-excitation of PeV cosmic ray nuclei after their parents have undergone photo-disintegration in an environment of ultraviolet photons. This process is proposed as a candidate explanation of the recently discovered HESS source at the edge of Westerlund 2. The UV background is provided by Lyman-alpha emission within the rich O and B stellar environment. The HESS flux results if there is efficient acceleration at the source of lower energy nuclei. The requirement that the Lorentz-boosted ultraviolet photons reach the Giant Dipole resonant energy (~ 20 MeV) implies a strong suppression of the gamma-ray spectrum compared to an E_\gamma^{-2} behavior at energies below about 1 TeV. This suppression is not apparent in the lowest-energy Westerlund 2 datum, but will be probed by the upcoming GLAST mission.

704.1366,Investigation of transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the MACHO   survey,"  Context: Planets outside our solar system transiting their host star, i. e. those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined. Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.   Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys. Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.   Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the radial velocities and spectral analyses.

There are many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of plasma flows in solar chromospheric flares. The main difficulty is the interpretation of line shifts or asymmetries. For many years, methods based on bisector techniques were used but they give a reliable results only for some specific conditions and in most cases cannot be applied.

A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an overall normalization.

705.3101,A complete one-loop description of associated tW production at LHC and   an estimate of possible genuine supersymmetric effects,"  We compute, in the MSSM framework, the sum of the one-loop electroweak and of the total QED radiation effects for the process $pp \to t W+X$, initiated by the parton process $bg\to tW$. Combining these terms with the existing NLO calculations of SM and SUSY QCD corrections, we analyze the overall one-loop supersymmetric effects on the partial rates of the process, obtained by integrating the differential cross section up to a final variable invariant mass. We conclude that, for some choices of the SUSY parameters and for relatively small final invariant masses, they could reach the relative ten percent level, possibly relevant for a dedicated experimental effort at LHC.

Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a \emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for (q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the ``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises' statistics and spectrum.

704.2612,Relativistic Effects in Extreme Mass Ratio Gravitational Wave Bursts,"  Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black hole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such dephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive black hole and obtain information about its spin.

Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.   Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.   Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2.

704.2189,Selection effects shaping the Gamma Ray Burst redshift distributions,"  Long Gamma Ray Bursts hold the promise of probing star-formation and metal enrichment up to very high redshifts. The present GRB samples with redshift determination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of selection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the observed GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined samples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift GRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected due to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized, compared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in shaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue that the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be z<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased against low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame afterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration, implies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust composition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is probably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z GRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due to the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of high redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of even 10m class telescopes.

704.3149,Effects of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of diffuse clouds,"  Aims. We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the interface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral medium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical simulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of radiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion spreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the CNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to the lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport increase the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O. Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact with the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at the interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content at the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps exciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are found higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical models of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for the interpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formation and presence of H$_3^+$.

Similarly, the ionizing photon luminosity -- (abridged; many important details omitted). Synchronized star formation around the periphery of Carina provides a strong case that star formation here was indeed triggered by stellar winds and UV radiation. This second generation appears to involve a cascade toward preferentially intermediate- and low-mass stars, but this may soon change when eta Car and its siblings explode. If the current reservoir of atomic and molecular gas can be tapped at that time, massive star formation may be rejuvinated around the periphery of Carina much as if it were a young version of Gould's Belt. Also, when these multiple SNe occur, the triggered second generation will be pelted repeatedly with SN ejecta bearing short-lived radioactive nuclides.

It is found that the gate operations must be subject to less than 5.3% error. An existing proof that purification is equivalent to error correction is used to show that this bound can also be applied to concatenated error correcting codes in the presence of noisy gates, and hence gives a limit to the tolerable error rate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer formed by concatenation. This is shown to apply also to the case where error detection and post-selection, as proposed by Knill, is used to enhance the threshold. We demonstrate the trade-off between gate/environmentally induced faulty rotations and qubit loss errors. ",quant-ph,"Bounding Fault-Tolerant Thresholds for Purification and Quantum   Computation.

An existing proof that purification is equivalent to error correction is used to show that this bound can also be applied to concatenated error correcting codes in the presence of noisy gates, and hence gives a limit to the tolerable error rate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer formed by concatenation. This is shown to apply also to the case where error detection and post-selection, as proposed by Knill, is used to enhance the threshold. We demonstrate the trade-off between gate/environmentally induced faulty rotations and qubit loss errors.",['quant-ph']

Here we show that the spinons are deconfined for $N>N_c=36$, thus leading to an insulating state known as spin liquid. A previous analysis considerably underestimated the value of $N_c$. We show further that for $20<N\leq 36$ there can be either a confined or a deconfined phase, depending on the instanton density. For $N\leq 20$ only the confined phase exist. For the physically relevant value N=2 we argue that no paramagnetic phase can emerge, since chiral symmetry breaking would disrupt it.

We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization. The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed markets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to the same business sector.

We present a sample-wide trend between host galaxy isophotal structure and the inclination of dusty circumnuclear disks at the centers of 13 of these objects.

First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the low-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod, fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes, are discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little similar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A revised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based on this continuum form.

We furthermore detect: ortho-H2CO 2-1, 3-2; CN 1-0, 2-1; HCO+, 1-0. 3-2, HCN 3-2, HNC 1-0, 3-2 (and tentatively OCS 12-11). The HCN, HCO+, H2CO and CN line emission can be fitted to densities of n=5 x 10E4 - 10E5 cm-3 and gas temperatures Tk=80-150 K. Both HNC and HC3N are, however, significantly more excited than the other species which requires higher gas densities - or radiative excitation through e.g. mid-IR pumping. The HCN line intensity is fainter than that of HCO+ and HNC for the 3-2 transition, in contrast to previous findings for the 1-0 lines where the HCN emission is the most luminous. We tentatively suggest that the observed molecular line emission is consistent with a young starburst, where the emission can be understood as emerging from dense, warm gas with an additional PDR component. We find that X-ray chemistry is not required to explain the observed mm line emission, including the HCN/HCO+ 1-0 and 3-2 line ratios. The luminous HC3N line emission is an expected signature of dense, starforming gas. A deeply buried AGN can not be excluded, but its impact on the surrounding molecular medium is then suggested to be limited. However, detailed modelling of HC3N abundances in X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) should be carried out.

706.0732,Hot Jupiters in binary star systems,"  Radial velocity surveys find Jupiter mass planets with semi-major axes a less than 0.1 AU around ~1% of solar-type stars; counting planets with $a$ as large as 5 AU, the fraction of stars having planets reaches ~ 10% {Marcy,Butler}. An examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5% of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au of their parent star.

The energy spectra and angular distributions of the pair are found analytically for the first time. The energy spectrum for each lepton exhibits a sharp maximum located well above the threshold for any polarization of the laser field. The angular distributions of leptons depend on the polarization: for the linear polarization both leptons move predominantly along the laser beam direction; for the circular polarization leptons are emitted in a thin-walled cone centered on the laser beam. The spectral and angular distributions found are governed by the intensity and frequency of the field, and the frequency independent total pair creation rates comply with the previously known results.

The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the lattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice artifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the pion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic correlation functions. We determine the leading order, $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$, and next to leading order, $\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_\pi^2)$, additive mass shift of \textit{valence-sea} mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence fermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current large scale mixed action lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved coarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice units by $\Delta(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_\pi)^2$, which in physical units, using $a=0.125$ fm, corresponds to $\Delta(m)^2 = (291\pm 8 \textrm{MeV})^2 -0.06(2) m_\pi^2$.

In both systems, interactions of electrons with either phonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain superconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago proposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in superconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar dichotomy. Namely, the electron-phonon coupling is highly anisotropic, diverging near a saddle point in the graphene electronic band structure.

Galaxy Mergers & Quasar Activity","  (Abridged) We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. Combining halo mass functions (MFs) with empirical halo occupation models, we calculate where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare with observed merger MFs, clustering, fractions, and small-scale environments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations. Making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasar LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is a natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. We show that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk instabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at Seyfert luminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale), pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution, and host galaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z>1 quasar luminosity density.

The temperature and magnetic field dependence of chi(T) and C(T) evidence ferromagnetic (FM) order at TC=15K. Thus, CeRuPO seems to be one of the rare example of a FM Kondo lattice. In contrast, CeOsPO shows antiferromagnetic order at TN=4.4K despite only minor changes in lattice parameters and electronic configuration. Additional 31P NMR results support these scenarios. LSDA+U calculations evidence a quasi two dimensional electronic band structure, reflecting a strong covalent bonding within the CeO and RuP layers and a weak ionic like bonding between the layers.",['cond-mat.str-el']

Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be determined by their representation theoretical properties.   Suppose that a finite group $Q$ acts on an abelian group $A$ so that there exists a bijective 1-cocycle $\pi\in Z^1(Q,\ach)$, where $\ach=\rm{Hom}(A,\C^*)$ is endowed with the diagonal $Q$-action. Under this assumption, Etingof and Gelaki gave an explicit formula for a non-degenerate 2-cocycle in $Z^2(G,\C^*)$, where $G:=A\rtimes Q$. Hence, the semidirect product $G$ is of central type.   In this paper we present a more general correspondence between bijective and non-degenerate cohomology classes.

704.0961,On the orbital period of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable HS 0922+1333,  Context: The object HS 0922+1333 was visited briefly in 2002 in a mini survey of low accretion rate polars (LARPs) in order to test if they undergo high luminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that short observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar (Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin period appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results: New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point. ,astro-ph,On the orbital period of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable HS 0922+1333.

In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e., power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and the formula for power efficiency factor.

704.26,On the cycling operation in braid groups,"  The cycling operation is a special kind of conjugation that can be applied to elements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a key ingredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In their seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\it cycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting for cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem, mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre which shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result also holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.   On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually solved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets (left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right normal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search problem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think that even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small right-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case of rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of a given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the isomorphism being defined using iterated cycling.

706.1307,Finite-size effects in roughness distribution scaling,"  We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for roughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1 dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling. However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling exponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1 dimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations works properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the expected asymptotic values. Thus, although roughness distributions are clearly better than other quantities to determine the universality class of a growing system, it is not the final solution for this task.

Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access to low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10 times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white dwarfs.

We find that the time-domain 3.5PN template family, which includes the inspiral phase, has fitting factors (FFs) >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 20 Msun. The time-domain 3.5PN effective-one-body template family, which includes the inspiral, merger and ring-down phases, gives satisfactory signal-matching performance with FFs >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 120 Msun.

We assume that the dielectric function of the sphere presents a Drude-like behavior or an ionic crystal behavior modelling metallic and semiconducting materials.

We prove that ""resonant surface polariton modes"" are generated by a unique surface wave, i.e., a surface (plasmon or phonon) polariton, propagating close to the sphere surface. This surface polariton corresponds to a particular Regge pole of the electric part (TM) of the S matrix of the sphere. From the associated Regge trajectory we can construct semiclassically the spectrum of the complex frequencies of the resonant surface polariton modes which can be considered as Breit-Wigner-type resonances. Furthermore, by taking into account the Stokes phenomenon, we derive an asymptotic expression for the position in the complex angular momentum plane of the surface polariton Regge pole. We then describe semiclassically the surface polariton and provide analytical expressions for its dispersion relation and its damping in the non-absorbing and absorbing cases. In these analytic expressions, we more particularly exhibit well-isolated terms directly linked to absorption.

705.2424,Spin-Hall edge spin polarization in a ballistic 2D electron system,"  Universal properties of spin-Hall effect in ballistic 2D electron systems are addressed. The net spin polarization across the edge of the conductor is second order, ~\lambda^2, in spin-orbit coupling constant independent of the form of the boundary potential, with the contributions of normal and evanescent modes each being ~ \sqrt{\lambda} but of opposite signs. This general result is confirmed by the analytical solution for a hard-wall boundary, which also yields the detailed distribution of the local spin polarization. The latter shows fast (Friedel) oscillations with the spin-orbit coupling entering via the period of slow beatings only. Long-wavelength contributions of evanescent and normal modes exactly cancel each other in the spectral distribution of the local spin density.

705.0224,Evaporation of buffer gas-thermalized anions out of a multipole rf ion   trap,"  We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism out of a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that the evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes, however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.

These observations are compared to the predictions of a radiative transfer model coupled to a chemical network that includes depletion on grains and gas phase deuterium fractionation. Together with previous observations and modelling of CO and isotopologues, our H13CO+ and DCO+ observations and modelling allow to place constraints on the metal abundance and the cosmic ionization rate. The H13CO+ emission is well reproduced for metals abundances lower than 3e-9 and a standard cosmic ray ionization rate. However, the observations are also consistent with a complete depletion of metals, i.e. with cosmic rays as the only source of ionization at visual extinctions greater than a few Av . The DCO+ emission is found to be dependent of the ortho to para H2 ratio, and indicates a ratio of ~1e-2. The derived ionization fraction is about 5e-9 with respect to H nuclei, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the one observed in the L1544 core.

704.2621,Experimental studies on vacancy induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2,  Room temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped TiO2 films deposited on Si substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The ferromagnetic properties of the samples depend on the oxygen partial pressure during the PLD synthesis. The appearance of higher binding energy component (HBEC) in the oxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the presence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the synthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly related to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases with oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements were performed to study the electronic structure of both stoichometric and reduced TiO2. The analyses show the presence of Ti 3d band near the Fermi level in reduced TiO2 samples. These bands are otherwise empty in stoichiometric TiO2 and reside in the conduction band which makes them unobservable by XPS. The existence of this Ti 3d band near the Fermi level can possibly lead to Stoner splitting of the band. ,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,Experimental studies on vacancy induced ferromagnetism in undoped TiO2.

704.0863,A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version),"  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

705.1289,Discrete Thermodynamics of Lasers,"  The paper offers a discrete thermodynamic model of lasers. Laser is an open system; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one related to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The basic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to which are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the relative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity correspondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of the up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even in a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and down), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the population inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the Einstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel lasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for the emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the lasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper and lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel laser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between levels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for the functioning of laser.

Multilevel lasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for the emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the lasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper and lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel laser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between levels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for the functioning of laser.",['physics.optics']

We start with the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. We summarize the results of neutrino experiments using solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. We update the leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation of this data. We describe the method and present results on our understanding of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance in these fronts is also briefly summarized.

704.239,Neglecting the porosity of hot-star winds can lead to underestimating   mass-loss rates,"  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically thin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical mass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping'' impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the optically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions: Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically thick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore, neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating empirical mass-loss rates.

Space and time are treated as two orthogonal, symmetric and complementary quantities under the atomic spacetime. Electronic motion observed the rule of differential and integral operations that were implemented by dynamic trigonometric functions. It is demonstrated that the atomic spacetime is not a linear vector space with Newtonian time, and within which calculus has non-classical definition, and complex wave functions have fresh physical significances. This alternative approach is original, informative and refreshing but still compatible with quantum mechanics in the formulation. The description of electronic resonance in helium is also comparable with classical mechanics such as an oscillating pendulum and with classical electromagnetism such as an LC oscillator.

706.036,Towards an Explicit Model of D-brane Inflation,"  We present a detailed analysis of an explicit model of warped D-brane inflation, incorporating the effects of moduli stabilization. We consider the potential for D3-brane motion in a warped conifold background that includes fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes involved in moduli stabilization. Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies: in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point. Finally, we comment on the difficulty of making precise cosmological predictions in this scenario. This is the companion paper to arXiv:0705.3837.

704.2011,Self consistency in hadron physics,"  In this talk we discuss at hand of two examples the crucial role played by self consistency in hadron physics. The first example concerns the quark-mass dependence of the baryon octet and decuplet masses. It is shown that within a self consistent one-loop approach based on the chiral Lagrangian the 'mysterious' quark-mass dependence of the $\Xi$ mass predicted by the MILC collaboration may be recovered in terms of a discontinuous chiral extrapolation. This is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial summation, i.e. the masses used in the loop functions are identical to those obtained from the baryon self energies. In the second example we discuss recent studies on the properties of D mesons in cold nuclear matter as they are predicted by coupled-channel dynamics. Here a self consistent many-body approach reveals the close interlink of the properties of D meson and open-charm baryon resonances in nuclear matter. The relevance of exotic baryon resonances for the spectral distortion of the $D_s^\pm$ in nuclear matter is pointed out. ",nucl-th,"Self consistency in hadron physics.

In this first paper, I present a new set of simplified equations modeling the growth and migration of various species of grains in a gaseous protostellar disk evolving as a result of the combined effects of viscous accretion and photo-evaporation from the central star. Using the assumption that the grain size distribution function always maintains a power-law structure approximating the average outcome of the exact coagulation/shattering equation, the model focuses on the calculation of the growth rate of the largest grains only. The coupled evolution equations for the maximum grain size, the surface density of the gas and the surface density of solids are then presented and solved self-consistently using a standard 1+1 dimensional formalism. I show that the global evolution of solids is controlled by a leaky reservoir of small grains at large radii, and propose an empirically derived evolution equation for the total mass of solids, which can be used to estimate the total heavy element retention efficiency in the planet formation paradigm. Consistency with observation of the total mass of solids in the Minimum Solar Nebula augmented with the mass of the Oort cloud sets strong upper limit on the initial grain size distribution, as well as on the turbulent parameter $\alphat$.

A model of such networks in computer data transmission is discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes.

In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient.

We review this observation in the context of a one parameter family of quintic threefolds, and study the zeta-function as a function of the parameter \phi. Owing to cancellations, the superdeterminant of an infinite matrix reduces to the (ordinary) determinant of a finite matrix, U(\phi), corresponding to the action of the Frobenius map on certain cohomology groups.

The periods are defined by series that converge for $|\phi|_p < 1$. The values of \phi that are of interest are those for which \phi^p = \phi so, for nonzero \phi, we have |\vph|_p=1.

This wave packet satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. The calculation of the tunneling probabilities shows that the universe may emerge from the Planck era to an inflationary phase. It also shows that, the tunneling probability is a function of the mean energy of the initial wave packet and of two parameters related to the Chaplygin gas.

However, so far only a handful of Compton thick AGNs have been possibly detected using even the deepest Chandra and XMM surveys. Compton-thick AGNs can be recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the AGN UV emission in the infrared by selecting sources with AGN luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faint near-infrared and optical emission. To this purpose, we make use of deep HST, VLT, Spitzer and Chandra data on the Chandra Deep Field South to constrain the number of Compton thick AGN in this field. We show that sources with high 24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct source population, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by AGN emission.

The low spectral index derived from the dust emission as well as the flat geometry of the disk suggest a more rapid evolution of the disks associated with massive stars. In the Discussion, we dare to propose a possible evolutionary sequence for the warm circumstellar material around IM stars.",['astro-ph']
704.1201,Evaluation of the Axial Vector Commutator Sum Rule for Pion-Pion   Scattering,"  We consider the sum rule proposed by one of us (SLA), obtained by taking the expectation value of an axial vector commutator in a state with one pion. The sum rule relates the pion decay constant to integrals of pion-pion cross sections, with one pion off the mass shell. We remark that recent data on pion-pion scattering allow a precise evaluation of the sum rule. We also discuss the related Adler--Weisberger sum rule (obtained by taking the expectation value of the same commutator in a state with one nucleon), especially in connection with the problem of extrapolation of the pion momentum off its mass shell. We find, with current data, that both the pion-pion and pion-nucleon sum rules are satisfied to better than six percent, and we give detailed estimates of the experimental and extrapolation errors in the closure discrepancies.

706.0396,Quantum theory of exciton-photon coupling in photonic crystal slabs with   embedded quantum wells,"  A theoretical description of radiation-matter coupling for semiconductor-based photonic crystal slabs is presented, in which quantum wells are embedded within the waveguide core layer. A full quantum theory is developed, by quantizing both the electromagnetic field with a spatial modulation of the refractive index and the exciton center of mass field in a periodic piecewise constant potential. The second-quantized hamiltonian of the interacting system is diagonalized with a generalized Hopfield method, thus yielding the complex dispersion of mixed exciton-photon modes including losses. The occurrence of both weak and strong coupling regimes is studied, and it is concluded that the new eigenstates of the system are described by quasi-particles called photonic crystal polaritons, which can occur in two situations: (i) below the light line, when a resonance between exciton and non-radiative photon levels occurs (guided polaritons), (ii) above the light line, provided the exciton-photon coupling is larger than the intrinsic radiative damping of the resonant photonic mode (radiative polaritons). For a square lattice of air holes, it is found that the energy minimum of the lower polariton branch can occur around normal incidence. The latter result has potential implications for the realization of polariton parametric interactions in photonic crystal slabs.

704.3915,NBODY meets stellar population - The HYDE-PARC Project,"  N-body simulations give us a rough idea of how the shape of a simulated object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code, NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.

With cosmological three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with virial temperatures of 10^4 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that radius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filaments reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of two from the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from one to three in the cooling cases. This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and interestingly remains supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies even in the absence of any feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3 orders of magnitude in length scale with the turbulent pressure prevailing over the thermal energy.

The slowly varying sum S_\gamma(n)+n is an important subsum in application of the Li criterion for the Riemann hypothesis.","['math-ph', 'math.MP']"

Both the dots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimes between Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammatic approach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacing we obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. It turns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's function can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use this information to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has an attractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the other is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find that the critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second dot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuation magnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in this regime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from the cooperon scaling function.

706.0262,Spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos,"  Based on a cosmological N-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematic alignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group size host halos (Rvir). We measure three different types of spatial alignment: halo alignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and the distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the orientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the directions of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment: the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting line between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the orientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment between the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that satellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at least 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially point towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales but a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is weaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All velocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest that the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which extends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main contribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the satellite orientations in the group tidal field. The projected data reveal good agreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys. (abridged) ",astro-ph,"Spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos.

In addition to some processes previously considered, we also examine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two mechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media influence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the network of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence, where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of interactions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing that cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media influence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action (direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of the full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that the enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media only occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous studies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in combination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural homogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are more efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media messages or indirect global mass media influences.

What fraction of the known dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe can have this origin is still a matter of debate. Aims: In our effort to understand the origin and evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies and their correspondence with local objects, the first step is to understand how these galaxies (which are supposed to have a limited amount of dark matter) react to the feedback of the ongoing star formation. Methods: We make use of 2-D chemodynamical calculations in order to study the early evolution of isolated, dark matter-free dwarf galaxies. We present models in which feedback parameters are varied. We also compare the results with dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy models. Results: All the considered models show that the star formation proceeds for more than 300 Myr, therefore dwarf galaxies without large dark matter halos are not necessarily quickly destroyed. The chemical evolution of these objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dSphs of the Local Group. Models with large dark matter halos show results consistent with models free of dark matter, indicating that the distribution of gas is more important than the depth of the potential well in determining the global behaviour of dSph-sized dwarf galaxies.

The {\em generalized} fluctuation-dissipation relation, however, states that even under strongly thermodynamically non-equilibrium conditions the ratio of the probability of a transition to the probability of the time-reverse of that transition is the exponent of the change in the internal energy of the system due to the transition. Here, we derive an extension of the generalized fluctuation dissipation theorem for a Brownian motor for the ratio between the probability for the motor to take a forward step and the probability to take a backward step.","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cond-mat.soft']"

704.3453,An Adaptive Strategy for the Classification of G-Protein Coupled   Receptors,"  One of the major problems in computational biology is the inability of existing classification models to incorporate expanding and new domain knowledge. This problem of static classification models is addressed in this paper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in bioinformatics. Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their existing models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes available. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread machine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable as a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the G-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%.

704.0954,Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed   Consensus,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate, or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

706.0005,Gravitational Stability of Circumnuclear Disks in Elliptical Galaxies,"  A significant fraction of nearby elliptical galaxies are known to have high density gas disks in their circumnuclear (CN) region (0.1 to a few kpc). Yet, ellipticals, especially luminous ones, show little signs of recent star formation (SF). To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole (BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.

704.0968,Criteria in the Selection of Target Events for Planetary Microlensing   Follow-Up Observation,"  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim 10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars with magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.

Selecting clusters by concentration thus has no effect on the lensing cross section. The most efficiently lensing and hottest clusters are typically the \textit{least} concentrated in samples with a broad mass range.

The group $SO(3)_{F}$ is treated as a chiral gauged flavour symmetry. Electroweak-, flavour- and Higgs interactions are unified in one single gauge group SU(7) which is broken again down to $G_{SM}^{ex}$ by orbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions. The compactification scale is O(1) TeV. The orbifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ is put on a lattice. This setting gives a staring point for RG-transformations. As a result the bulk is integrated out and the extra dimension consist of only two points: the orbifold fixed points. Parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become nonunitary as a result of the blockspin transformations. In addition, a Higgs potential emerges naturally. The PTs can be written as a product $e^{A_{y}} e^{\eta} e^{A_{y}}$ of unitary factors $e^{A_{y}}$ and a selfadjoint factor $e^{\eta}$. The reduction $48 \to 35 + 6 + \bar{6} + 1$ of the adjoint reps of SU(7) with respect to $SU(6) \supset G_{SM}^{ex}$ leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$ Higgs doublets: one for each flavour.

Here, quantum (Hall) effects and relativistic effects of intense many body spin-orbital interactions for novel orbital rehybridization dynamics (Little Effect) are proposed in this new dynamical magnetic mechanism. This dynamic ferromagnetic mechanism is proven by imposing dynamic and static magnetic fields during CNT syntheses and observing the different influence of these external magnetic environments on the catalyzing spin currents and spin waves and the resulting CNT formation.","['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.mes-hall']"

704.2881,Current status of Japanese detectors,"  Current status of TAMA and CLIO detectors in Japan is reported in this article. These two interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are being developed for the large cryogenic gravitational wave telescope (LCGT) which is a future plan for detecting gravitational wave signals at least once per year.   TAMA300 is being upgraded to improve the sensitivity in low frequency region after the last observation experiment in 2004. To reduce the seismic noises, we are installing new seismic isolation system, which is called TAMA Seismic Attenuation System, for the four test masses. We confirmed stable mass locks of a cavity and improvements of length and angular fluctuations by using two SASs. We are currently optimizing the performance of the third and fourth SASs. We continue TAMA300 operation and R&D studies for LCGT. Next data taking in the summer of 2007 is planned.   CLIO is a 100-m baseline length prototype detector for LCGT to investigate interferometer performance in cryogenic condition. The key features of CLIO are that it locates Kamioka underground site for low seismic noise level, and adopts cryogenic Sapphire mirrors for low thermal noise level. The first operation of the cryogenic interferometer was successfully demonstrated in February of 2006. Current sensitivity at room temperature is close to the target sensitivity within a factor of 4. Several observation experiments at room temperature have been done.

The latter starts with a big bang and, in the case the transition does not occur, ends with a big crunch. A temperature duality exchanges the two cosmological branches. In the limit where the pure de Sitter universe is recovered, the tunnel effect reduces to a ""creation from nothing"", due to the vanishing of the big bang branch.

704.2032,Effects of the galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distribution of   dwarf spheroidal galaxies,"  To study the effects of galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distributions and on the evolution of Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we compared the predictions of several chemical evolution models, adopting different prescriptions for the galactic winds, with the photometrically-derived stellar metallicity distributions of both galaxies. The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 0.5 instead of $\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same.

A simple exponentiation for resummation leads to divergent results. We study the resummation of these $\ln^2 x$ terms. We show that the $\ln^2 x$ terms come partly from the light-cone wave function(LCWF) and partly from the form factor. We introduce a jet factor to factorize the $\ln^2 x$ term in the form factor.

705.0155,Accreting Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Systems,"  Using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RossiXTE), astronomers have discovered that disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three distinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations. These oscillations are powered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong gravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that has accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the oscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational field of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can therefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important astrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond pulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields required to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases, but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars show that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the magnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of angular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show whether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the kilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is predicted by strong-field general relativity. It has also greatly narrowed the possible descriptions of ultradense matter. ",astro-ph,"Accreting Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Systems.

704.1679,Equation of State in Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics: variable versus   constant adiabatic index,"  The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic magnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits. Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the solution.

We identify 8 AGN in all four of these clusters from the Chandra data, which are sensitive to AGN with hard X-ray (2-10keV) luminosity L_{X,H} > 10^43 erg/s in host galaxies more luminous than a rest frame M_R < -20 mag. This stands in sharp contrast to the one AGN with L_{X,H} > 10^43 erg/s we discovered in our earlier study of eight low-redshift clusters with z=0.06-0.31 (average z~0.2). Three of the four high-redshift cluster datasets are sensitive to nearly L_{X,H} > 10^42 erg/s and we identify seven AGN above this luminosity limit, compared to two in eight, low-redshift clusters.

705.2724,Self-affirmation model for football goal distributions,"  Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework.

",physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech,"Self-affirmation model for football goal distributions.   Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. It turns out that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described by independent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial or generalized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from first principles, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include a simple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework.

704.2811,On Algebraic Decoding of $q$-ary Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon   Codes,"  We consider a list decoding algorithm recently proposed by Pellikaan-Wu \cite{PW2005} for $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $\mathcal{RM}_q(\ell, m, n)$ of length $n \leq q^m$ when $\ell \leq q$. A simple and easily accessible correctness proof is given which shows that this algorithm achieves a relative error-correction radius of $\tau \leq (1 - \sqrt{{\ell q^{m-1}}/{n}})$. This is an improvement over the proof using one-point Algebraic-Geometric codes given in \cite{PW2005}. The described algorithm can be adapted to decode Product-Reed-Solomon codes.   We then propose a new low complexity recursive algebraic decoding algorithm for Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon codes. Our algorithm achieves a relative error correction radius of $\tau \leq \prod_{i=1}^m (1 - \sqrt{k_i/q})$.

From new K band observations of over 100 PNe supplemented by data from the literature, we have detected the emission lines [Kr III] 2.199 and/or [Se IV] 2.287 $\mu$m in 81 of 120 objects. We determine Se and Kr elemental abundances, employing ionization correction formulae derived in the first paper of this series. We find a significant range in Se and Kr abundances, from near solar (no enrichment) to enhanced by >1.0 dex relative to solar, which we interpret as self-enrichment due to in situ s-process nucleosynthesis. Kr tends to be more strongly enriched than Se; in 18 objects exhibiting both Se and Kr emission, we find that [Kr/Se] = 0.5$\pm$0.2.   Our survey has increased the number of PNe with n-capture element abundance determinations by a factor of ten, enabling us for the first time to search for correlations with other nebular properties. As expected, we find a positive correlation between s-process enrichments and the C/O ratio. Type I and bipolar PNe, which arise from intermediate-mass progenitors (>3-4 solar masses), exhibit little to no s-process enrichments. Finally, PNe with H-deficient Wolf-Rayet central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process enrichments than objects with H-rich nuclei. Overall, 44% of the PNe in our sample display significant s-process enrichments (>0.3 dex).

704.1765,Spitzer Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy of Infrared Luminous Galaxies at z~2   II: Diagnostics,"  We present mid-IR spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 Spitzer-selected ULIRGs spanning z~1-3 and likely L_IR~10^12-10^13Lsun. Our study aims at quantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent results suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of star-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical optically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission, but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high 5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that star-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2 sources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At these luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe. We find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent with local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on SCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show extreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find that our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude more luminous.

The volume (at fixed $\tau$) remains finite in this limit and is given by the universal formula $V(\tau) = {4\over 3}\pi (2\ln \cosh{\tau\over 2}-\tanh^2{\tau\over 2})$ plus corrections (given by a series in $e^{-t_q}$) which begin at order $e^{-4t_q}$. The coefficents of the corrections depend on the geometry of ${\cal I}^+$. This behaviour is shown to be consistent with the no-hair property of cosmological event horizons and with calculations of de-Sitter quasinormal modes in the literature.

The resulting force then has the character of a strong version of the van der Waals force, whose superior strength can be attributed to relatively coherent primary fields (compared with the totally incoherent effects of the ZPF). The model also predicts the existence of a background having some of the character of dark energy.

704.3683,The Complexity of Weighted Boolean #CSP,"  This paper gives a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of computing the partition function of an instance of a weighted Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. The problem is parameterised by a finite set F of non-negative functions that may be used to assign weights to the configurations (feasible solutions) of a problem instance. Classical constraint satisfaction problems correspond to the special case of 0,1-valued functions. We show that the partition function, i.e. the sum of the weights of all configurations, can be computed in polynomial time if either (1) every function in F is of ``product type'', or (2) every function in F is ``pure affine''. For every other fixed set F, computing the partition function is FP^{#P}-complete. ",cs.CC math.CO,"The Complexity of Weighted Boolean #CSP.

705.111,Mining Patterns with a Balanced Interval,"  In many applications it will be useful to know those patterns that occur with a balanced interval, e.g., a certain combination of phone numbers are called almost every Friday or a group of products are sold a lot on Tuesday and Thursday.   In previous work we proposed a new measure of support (the number of occurrences of a pattern in a dataset), where we count the number of times a pattern occurs (nearly) in the middle between two other occurrences. If the number of non-occurrences between two occurrences of a pattern stays almost the same then we call the pattern balanced.   It was noticed that some very frequent patterns obviously also occur with a balanced interval, meaning in every transaction. However more interesting patterns might occur, e.g., every three transactions. Here we discuss a solution using standard deviation and average. Furthermore we propose a simpler approach for pruning patterns with a balanced interval, making estimating the pruning threshold more intuitive.

Unlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of- equilibrium systems is generally too complex to be captured by simple macroscopic laws. Here we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and crystal: a Bragg glass formed by vortices in a superconductor. We find that the response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales linearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the presence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical distribution of timescales, arising when chunks of loose vortices cannot move before trapped ones become dislodged, leads to a stretched-exponential response.

705.0618,The Black Hole Mass - Spheroid Luminosity relation,"  The differing M_bh-Luminosity relations presented in McLure & Dunlop, Marconi & Hunt and Erwin et al. have been investigated. A number of issues have been identified and addressed in each of these studies, including but not limited to: the removal of a dependency on the Hubble constant; a correction for dust attenuation in the bulges of disc galaxies; the identification of lenticular galaxies previously treated as elliptical galaxies; and application of the same (Y|X) regression analysis. These adjustments result in relations which now predict similar black hole masses. The optimal K-band relation is log(M_bh/M_sun) = -0.37(+/-0.04)[M_K +24] + 8.29(+/-0.08), with a total (not intrinsic) scatter in log M_bh equal to 0.33 dex. This level of scatter is similar to the value of 0.34 dex from the M_bh-sigma relation of Tremaine et al. and compares favourably with the value of 0.31 dex from the M_bh-n relation of Graham & Driver.

705.2246,Old Metal-rich Globular Cluster Populations: Peak Color and Peak   Metallicity Trends with Mass of Host Spheroids,"  We address the problem of the factors contributing to a peak color trend of old metal-rich globular cluster (MRGC) populations with mass of their hosts, early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can achieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the color trend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the [alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H] ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its range many times lower, i.e. of the order of Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.1 or even none, than the corresponding range deduced by assuming no age trend.

We address the problem of the factors contributing to a peak color trend of old metal-rich globular cluster (MRGC) populations with mass of their hosts, early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the assumption that age effects are small or negligible.

705.257,Outer jet X-ray and radio emission in R Aquarii: 1999.8 to 2004.0,"  Chandra and VLA observations of the symbiotic star R Aqr in 2004 reveal significant changes over the three to four year interval between these observations and previous observations taken with the VLA in 1999 and with Chandra in 2000. This paper reports on the evolution of the outer thermal X-ray lobe-jets and radio jets. The emission from the outer X-ray lobe-jets lies farther away from the central binary than the outer radio jets, and comes from material interpreted as being shock heated to ~10^6 K, a likely result of collision between high speed material ejected from the central binary and regions of enhanced gas density. Between 2000 and 2004, the Northeast (NE) outer X-ray lobe-jet moved out away from the central binary, with an apparent projected motion of ~580 km s^-1. The Southwest (SW) outer X-ray lobe-jet almost disappeared between 2000 and 2004, presumably due to adiabatic expansion and cooling. The NE radio bright spot also moved away from the central binary between 2000 and 2004, but with a smaller apparent velocity than of the NE X-ray bright spot.

704.3205,Renormalization and Effective Actions for General Relativity,"  Quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the renormalization group. The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy. Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the elementary particles.

We determine modes characterized as long - wavelength disturbances that are present in inhomogeneous media. This character of the system introduces additional difficulties for the stability analysis because the inhomogeneous nature of the medium determines the structure of the disturbance, which is no longer sinusoidal. Moreover, another complication is that we obtain a continuous spectrum of stable modes in addition to the discrete one.

We present the dataset and study the radius distribution and relations between radius, colour, arm/interarm region, galactocentric distance, mass and age. We select a sample of 7698 (F435W), 6846 (F555W) and 5024 (F814W) slightly resolved clusters and derive their effective radii by fitting the spatial profiles with analytical models convolved with the point spread function. The radii of 1284 clusters are studied in detail. We find cluster radii between 0.5 and ~10 pc, and one exceptionally large cluster candidate with a radius of 21.6 pc. The median radius is 2.1 pc. We find 70 clusters in our sample which have colours consistent with being old GC candidates and we find 6 new ""faint fuzzy"" clusters in, or projected onto, the disc of M51. The radius distribution can not be fitted with a power law, but a log-normal distribution provides a reasonable fit to the data. This indicates that shortly after the formation of the clusters from a fractal gas, their radii have changed in a non-uniform way. We find an increase in radius with colour as well as a higher fraction of redder clusters in the interarm regions, suggesting that clusters in spiral arms are more compact. We find a correlation between radius and galactocentric distance which is considerably weaker than the observed correlation for old Milky Way GCs. We find weak relations between cluster luminosity and radius, but we do not observe a correlation between cluster mass and radius. ",astro-ph,"ACS imaging of star clusters in M51. I.

705.0385,Radio and X-ray images of SNR G18.8+0.3 interacting with molecular   clouds,"  New HI images from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) show clear absorption features associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3. High-resolution $^{13}$CO images reveal that molecular clouds overlap the radio filaments of G18.8+0.3. The $^{13}$CO emission spectrum over the full velocity range in the direction of G18.8+0.3 shows two molecular components with high brightness-temperatureand three molecular components with low brightness-temperature, all with respective HI absorption. This implies that these clouds are in front of G18.8+0.3. In the HI images, the highest velocity absorption feature seen against the continuum image of G18.8+0.3 is at 129 km s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to the tangent point in this direction. This yields a lower distance limit of 6.9 kpc for G18.8+0.3. Absence of absorption at negative velocities gives an upper distance limit of 15 kpc. The broadened profile at 20$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ in the $^{13}$CO emission spectra is a strong indicator of a possible SNR/CO cloud interaction. Thus, G18.8+0.3 is likely to be at the distance of about 12 kpc.

705.3827,Width and mean curvature flow,"  Given a Riemannian metric on a homotopy $n$-sphere, sweep it out by a continuous one-parameter family of closed curves starting and ending at point curves. Pull the sweepout tight by, in a continuous way, pulling each curve as tight as possible yet preserving the sweepout. We show:   Each curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of the longest curve in the sweepout must itself be close to a closed geodesic. In particular, there are curves in the sweepout that are close to closed geodesics.   Finding closed geodesics on the 2-sphere by using sweepouts goes back to Birkhoff in 1917.   As an application, we bound from above, by a negative constant, the rate of change of the width for a one-parameter family of convex hypersurfaces that flows by mean curvature. The width is loosely speaking up to a constant the square of the length of the shortest closed curve needed to ``pull over'' $M$.

",math.DG math.AP math.GT,"Width and mean curvature flow.   Given a Riemannian metric on a homotopy $n$-sphere, sweep it out by a continuous one-parameter family of closed curves starting and ending at point curves. Pull the sweepout tight by, in a continuous way, pulling each curve as tight as possible yet preserving the sweepout. We show:   Each curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of the longest curve in the sweepout must itself be close to a closed geodesic. In particular, there are curves in the sweepout that are close to closed geodesics.   Finding closed geodesics on the 2-sphere by using sweepouts goes back to Birkhoff in 1917.   As an application, we bound from above, by a negative constant, the rate of change of the width for a one-parameter family of convex hypersurfaces that flows by mean curvature. The width is loosely speaking up to a constant the square of the length of the shortest closed curve needed to ``pull over'' $M$.

706.083,The importance of the merging activity for the kinetic polarization of   the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal from galaxy clusters,"  The polarization sensitivity of the upcoming millimetric observatories will open new possibilities for studying the properties of galaxy clusters and for using them as powerful cosmological probes. For this reason it is necessary to investigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals produced by their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (ICM). This work is focussed on the polarization effect induced by the ICM bulk motions, the so-called kpSZ signal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to the square of the tangential velocity. In particular we study how this polarization signal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is its dependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryonic component. This is done by producing realistic kpSZ maps starting from the outputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body simulations. The first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiative hydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement four different kinds of physical processes. Our results shows that the kpSZ signal turns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxy clusters. We find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to one order of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up to about 100 nuK. This result implies that the internal ICM dynamics must be taken into account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based on spherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates. Finally we find that the dependence on the physical modelling of the baryonic component is relevant only in the very inner regions of clusters.

At these temperatures, thermal desorption is negligible and hence a non-thermal desorption mechanism is necessary to maintain molecules in the gas phase. Here, the first laboratory study of the photodesorption of pure CO ice under ultra high vacuum is presented, which gives a desorption rate of 3E-3 CO molecules per UV (7-10.5 eV) photon at 15 K. This rate is factors of 1E2-1E5 larger than previously estimated and is comparable to estimates of other non-thermal desorption rates. The experiments constrains the mechanism to a single photon desorption process of ice surface molecules.

705.2196,Iron abundances of B-type post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars in globular   clusters: Barnard 29 in M 13 and ROA 5701 in omega Cen,"  High resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra of two B-type post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars in globular clusters, Barnard 29 in M 13 and ROA 5701 in omega Cen, have been analysed using model atmosphere techniques. The optical spectra have been obtained with FEROS on the ESO 2.2-m telescope and the 2d-Coud\'e spectrograph on the 2.7-m McDonald telescope, while the ultraviolet observations are from the GHRS on the HST. Abundances of light elements (C, N, O, Mg, Al and S) plus Fe have been determined from the optical spectra, while the ultraviolet data provide additional Fe abundance estimates from Fe III absorption lines in the 1875-1900 {\AA} wavelength region. A general metal underabundance relative to young B-type stars is found for both Barnard 29 and ROA 5701. These results are consistent with the metallicities of the respective clusters, as well as with previous studies of the objects. The derived abundance patterns suggest that the stars have not undergone a gas-dust separation, contrary to previous suggestions, although they may have evolved from the AGB before the onset of the third dredge-up. However, the Fe abundances derived from the HST spectra are lower than those expected from the metallicities of the respective clusters, by 0.5 dex for Barnard 29 and 0.8 dex for ROA 5701. A similar systematic underabundance is also found for other B-type stars in environments of known metallicity, such as the Magellanic Clouds. These results indicate that the Fe III ultraviolet lines may yield abundance values which are systematically too low by typically 0.6 dex and hence such estimates should be treated with caution.

The parameters providing the best fit are: Ko = 267.5 GPa, Vo = 24.284 cm3, alpha_o = 2.079x10^-5 K^-1, the pressure derivative of Ko is 1.556 and the pressure derivative of alpha_o is -1.098x10^-7 K^-1GPa^-1 .

These RMSD values are in the range of the uncertainty of the experiments, indicating that the five parameters semi-empirical EoS correctly describes the p-V-T relationships of perovskite.

The parameters providing the best fit are: Ko = 267.5 GPa, Vo = 24.284 cm3, alpha_o = 2.079x10^-5 K^-1, the pressure derivative of Ko is 1.556 and the pressure derivative of alpha_o is -1.098x10^-7 K^-1GPa^-1 . The root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) of the residuals are 0.043 cm3, 0.79 GPa, and 125 K for the molar volume, pressure, and temperature respectively. These RMSD values are in the range of the uncertainty of the experiments, indicating that the five parameters semi-empirical EoS correctly describes the p-V-T relationships of perovskite. Separating the experiments into 200 K ranges the semi-empirical EoS was compared to the most widely used finite strain, interatomic potential, and empirical isothermal EoSs such as the Birch-Murnaghan, the Vinet, and the Roy-Roy respectively. Correlation coefficients, RMSDs of the residuals and Akaike Information Criteria were used for evaluating the fitting. Based on these fitting parameters under pure isothermal conditions the semi-empirical p-V EoS is slightly weaker than the Birch-Murnaghan and Vinet EoSs; however, the semi-empirical p-V-T EoS is superior in every temperature range to all of the investigated conventional isothermal EoSs.",['physics.gen-ph']

This mechanism is based on generating longitudinal phonons as a result of parametric resonance caused by a permanent modulation of the transverse trap frequency in an elongated trap. The phonon-phonon interaction predetermines the self-consistent evolution which is completed with macroscopic population of one from all levels within the energy interval of parametric amplification. This level proves to be shifted to the edge of this interval.

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the young stellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning ages from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40 Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars. This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr, possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo. By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for the Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.

On the basis of our exact expressions we discuss the accuracy of the long-wavelength and the quasiclassical approximations.

705.2629,Dual Computations of Non-abelian Yang-Mills on the Lattice,"  In the past several decades there have been a number of proposals for computing with dual forms of non-abelian Yang-Mills theories on the lattice. Motivated by the gauge-invariant, geometric picture offered by dual models and successful applications of duality in the U(1) case, we revisit the question of whether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non-abelian dual models. Specifically, we consider three-dimensional SU(2) pure Yang-Mills as an accessible yet non-trivial case in which the gauge group is non-abelian. Using methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe Metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to prior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators, addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude with an outlook on further development of dual methods and their application to problems of current interest.

705.4632,Unplugging the Universe: the neglected electromagnetic consequence of   decoupling,"  This letter concentrates on the non-equilibrium evolution of magnetic field structures at the onset of recombination, when the charged particle current densities decay as neutrals are formed.   We consider the effect that a decaying magnetic flux has on the acceleration of particles via the transient induced electric field.

This radio galaxy, with a spectral index of 1.31 in the frequency range 365-4850 MHz, is one of the ultrasteep spectrum objects from the deep survey of a sky strip conducted with RATAN-600 in 1980-1981. We present arguments in favor of the identification of this line with Ly\alpha at redshift z=4.514. In this case, the object belongs to the group of extremely distant radio galaxies of ultrahigh radio luminosity (P_{1400}=1.3 x 10^{29}W Hz^{-1}). Such power can be provided only by a fairly massive black hole (~10^9M_\sun}) that formed in a time less than the age of the Universe at the observed z(1.3 Gyr) or had a primordial origin.

We then investigate the nature of a percolation transition in the correlated network with the Poisson degree distribution. It is found that negative correlation is irrelevant in that the percolation transition in the disassortative network belongs to the same universality class of the uncorrelated network. Positive correlation turns out to be relevant. The percolation transition in the assortative network is characterized by the non-diverging mean size of finite clusters and power-law scalings of the density of the largest cluster and the cluster size distribution in the non-percolating phase as well as at the critical point. Our results suggest that the unusual type percolation transition in the growing network models reported recently may be inherited from the assortative degree-degree correlation. ,cond-mat.stat-mech,Percolation transition in networks with degree-degree correlation.

704.3526,MgB2 single crystals substituted with Li and with Li-C: Structural and   superconducting properties,"  The effect of Li substitution for Mg and of Li-C co-substitution on the superconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has been investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone. This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals. Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates enhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including distortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result of two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to the changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to the increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new scattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or intraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and to the reduction of Tc.

We have confirmed that the radial velocity of Gl 570 D is coincident with that of the K-type primary star Gl 570 A, thus providing additional support for their true companionship. The presence of planetary-mass companions around 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5V) has been analyzed using five NIRSPEC radial velocity measurements obtained over a period of 4.37 yr. We have computed UVW space motions for a total of 21 L and T dwarfs within 20 pc of the Sun. This population shows UVW velocities that nicely overlap the typical kinematics of solar to M-type stars within the same spatial volume. However, the mean Galactic (44.2 km/s) and tangential (36.5 km/s) velocities of the L and T dwarfs appear to be smaller than those of G to M stars. A significant fraction (~40%) of the L and T dwarfs lies near the Hyades moving group (0.4-2 Gyr), which contrasts with the 10-12% found for earlier-type stellar neighbors.

Two basic FR profiles, Gaussian-shaped with a single polarity or ""N""-like with polarity reversals, are produced by a radio source occulted by a moving flux rope depending on its orientation. These curves are consistent with the Helios observations, providing evidence for the flux-rope geometry of CMEs. Many background radio sources can map CMEs in FR onto the sky. We demonstrate with a simple flux rope that the magnetic field orientation and helicity of the flux rope can be determined 2-3 days before it reaches Earth, which is of crucial importance for space weather forecasting. An FR calculation based on global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of CMEs in a background heliosphere shows that FR mapping can also resolve a CME geometry curved back to the Sun.

705.0867,Poisson approximation for non-backtracking random walks,"  Random walks on expander graphs were thoroughly studied, with the important motivation that, under some natural conditions, these walks mix quickly and provide an efficient method of sampling the vertices of a graph. Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a walk makes.   In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote the number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth $g$. We prove that if $g=\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is typically $\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\Omega(\log\log n)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\frac{1+o(1)}{\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all $t \leq (1-o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \geq (1+o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$.

705.2554,The Axiomatisation of Physics,"  Analysing Quantum Measurement requires analysing the physics of amplification since amplification of phenomena from one scale to another scale is essential to measurement. There still remains the task of working this into an axiomatic logical structure, what should be the foundational status of the concepts of measurement and probability. We argue that the concept of physical probability is a multi-scale phenomenon and as such, can be explicitly defined in terms of more fundamental physical concepts. Thus Quantum Mechanics can be given a logically unexceptionable axiomatisation.

Analysing Quantum Measurement requires analysing the physics of amplification since amplification of phenomena from one scale to another scale is essential to measurement. There still remains the task of working this into an axiomatic logical structure, what should be the foundational status of the concepts of measurement and probability. We argue that the concept of physical probability is a multi-scale phenomenon and as such, can be explicitly defined in terms of more fundamental physical concepts. Thus Quantum Mechanics can be given a logically unexceptionable axiomatisation.

We plot the trajectories of the interacting holographic dark energy model for different interaction cases as well as for different values of the parameter $c$ in the statefinder-plane. The statefinder diagrams characterize the properties of the holographic dark energy and show the discrimination between the two cases with and without interaction. As a result, we show the influence of the interaction to the evolution of the universe in the statefinder diagrams.

704.3943,Signatures of SUSY Dark Matter at the LHC and in the Spectra of Cosmic   Rays,"  This thesis discusses the search for supersymmetry at the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ongoing construction of one of the four large LHC experiments, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), and focuses on the detection of signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter in the spectra of cosmic rays.   Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model. However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced. Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.

The cores are linearly coupled by tunneling. Analysis of the corresponding system of linearly coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) reveals that spectral bandgaps of the single GPE split into subgaps. Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is studied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both traps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the other (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are found, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing them), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is predicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or symmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the bifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric counterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores is also studied.

705.1649,Quantum Measurement as a Final-State Interaction with a Macroscopic   External System,"  A small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) is studied in interaction with a large system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the microsystem in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as compared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis is carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking place within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variables in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the microsystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state. Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude for the microsystem is highly non-linear.   In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the ensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an entangled state.

705.3596,An XMM-Newton study of Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies,"  Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (HLIRGs) are the most luminous persistent objects in the Universe. They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and most of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to investigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive black hole growth. X-ray studies of HLIRGs have the potential to unravel the AGN contribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.   We have selected a sample of 14 HLIRGs observed by XMM-Newton (type 1, type 2 AGN and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be Compton-thick objects. This is the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carried out in the X-ray spectral band. Their X-ray spectral properties have been correlated with their IR luminosities, estimated by IRAS, ISO and sub-mm data.   The X-ray spectra of HLIRGs present heterogeneous properties. All our X-ray detected HLIRGs (10) have AGN-dominated X-ray spectra. The hard X-ray luminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure AGN contribution, while in the remaining 2 sources both an AGN and a starburst seem to contribute to the overall emission. We found soft excess emission in 5 sources. In one of them it is consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it is consistent with an AGN origin. The observed X-ray emission is systematically below the one expected for a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity, suggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or a departure from a standard spectral energy distribution of QSO.

704.0647,Testing String Theory with CMB,"  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory. Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r < 0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may present a challenge to string cosmology.   The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}.

Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent with previous work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than that for stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelength than the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seen face-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5).

Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach resonance in real experiments.

704.0719,Gravitational Wave Signals from Chaotic System: A Point Mass with A Disk,"  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit, we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of the orbit via the gravitational waves.

In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies.

The chain is regarded as a system of small particles which perform a brownian motion and are subjected to rigid constraints which forbid the breaking of the chain. For simplicity, all interactions among the particles have been switched off and the number of dimensions has been limited to two. The problem of describing the fluctuations of the chain in the limit in which it becomes a continuous system is solved using a path integral approach, in which the constraints are imposed with the insertion in the path integral of suitable Dirac delta functions. It is shown that the probability distribution of the possible conformations in which the fluctuating chain can be found during its evolution in time coincides with the partition function of a field theory which is a generalization of the nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions.

Optical detection at the single nanotube level should thus offer the possibility to examine these heterogeneities provided that both SWNT species are equally well detected. Here, we used photothermal heterodyne detection to record absorption images and spectra of individual SWNTs. Because this photothermal method relies only on light absorption, it readily detects metallic nanotubes as well as the emissive semiconducting species. The first and second optical transitions in individual semicontucting nanotubes have been probed. Comparison between the emission and absorption spectra of the lowest-lying optical transition reveal mainly small Stokes shifts.

Current methods for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) lead to heterogeneous samples containing mixtures of metallic and semiconducting species with a variety of lengths and defects. Optical detection at the single nanotube level should thus offer the possibility to examine these heterogeneities provided that both SWNT species are equally well detected. Here, we used photothermal heterodyne detection to record absorption images and spectra of individual SWNTs. Because this photothermal method relies only on light absorption, it readily detects metallic nanotubes as well as the emissive semiconducting species. The first and second optical transitions in individual semicontucting nanotubes have been probed. Comparison between the emission and absorption spectra of the lowest-lying optical transition reveal mainly small Stokes shifts.

In the gapped B phase, the ground state has a non-trivial topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral central charge, which reflects the chiral anomaly of the edge state. We proved that the topological number is identified to the reduced eta-invariant and this anomaly may be cancelled by a bulk Wess-Zumino term of SO(3) group through an index theorem in 2+1 dimensions.","['cond-mat.str-el', 'cond-mat.mes-hall', 'hep-th']"

Historically, the source has been shown to vary dramatically in 2-10 keV flux over timescales of years and was thought to be slowly transitioning between periods of quiescence and active accretion. Our results show that in one year the source continuum flux covered almost the entire historical range, making it unlikely that the low-luminosity states correspond to the accretion mechanism switching off. During flaring episodes we found that a highly redshifted Fe K line appears, implying that the violent activity is occurring in the inner accretion disk, within ~100 gravitational radii of the central black hole. We also found that the spectral index of the X-ray continuum remained approximately constant during the large amplitude variability. These observations make NGC 2992 well-suited for future multi-waveband monitoring, as a test-bed for constraining accretion models.

We detected 72 sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field towards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies with probable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1) for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV -- submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of 18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies, specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1.

704.3331,Light nuclei in galactic globular clusters : constraints on the   self-enrichment scenario from nucleosynthesis,"  Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case of NGC6752. We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature, adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates. Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametrized calculations allow us to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC6752 are nicely reproduced simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed material with 30 % of unprocessed gas. The observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and F-Na anticorrelations, as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be recovered by assuming mixing with even larger dilution factors. Li production by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in the case of NGC 6752.

Consistency requires that the corresponding box measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a ``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment. ",quant-ph,"Complementarity in the Einstein-Bohr Photon Box.

As we show by explicit calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable, they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a ``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment.",['quant-ph']

704.0616,Millimeter imaging of HD 163296: probing the disk structure and   kinematics,"  We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7 mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane. The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200 AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally, we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O. We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the dust distribution by a low mass companion.

705.0907,Structure of the stationary state of the asymmetric target process,"  We introduce a novel migration process, the target process. This process is dual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the rate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure site, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target process. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target process, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of a bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\rho_c$, irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied sites. The local density of the latter is equal to $\rho_c$ and their occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density $\rho_0$ much larger than $\rho_c$.

705.3173,Probing the Impact of Stellar Duplicity on Planet Occurrence with   Spectroscopic and Imaging Observations,"  Although it is commonly agreed that the presence of a close stellar companion is likely to affect planet formation and evolution, the precise effects and their actual impact on planet occurrence and properties are still debated. In particular, observational constraints are sparse, a consequence of the discrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches. To bring observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in binaries and multiple stars, we have been conducting two dedicated observing programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring. In this chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these two programs. A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT/NACO imaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of planets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU. On the radial-velocity side, current results confirm that the use of two-dimensional correlation allows to search for circumprimary giant planets in many types of spectroscopic binaries. Definitive results from our ongoing planet search in spectroscopic binaries should yield important constraints on the closest binaries susceptible of hosting circumprimary giant planets.

704.3005,A balanced memory network,"  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is understanding how working memory -- the ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of seconds -- is implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely candidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has gone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter century of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In particular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that attractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally during working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under biologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an attractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other. Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field analysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network scales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been suggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones.

705.4139,Our Peculiar Motion Away from the Local Void,"  The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at ~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from the void center.

705.4158,Can dark matter be a Bose-Einstein condensate?,"  We consider the possibility that the dark matter, which is required to explain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study the condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case of a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian tangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good agreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data for the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing through the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light is computed. The bending angle obtained for the Bose-Einstein condensate is larger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter models. Therefore the study of the light deflection by galaxies and the gravitational lensing could discriminate between the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model and other dark matter models.

We use the publicly available, 24 micron Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS catalogs from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) - North and South fields, which are centered on the 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North and the 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, to identify bright (S_24 > 80 microJy) mid-infrared sources that may be powered by heavily obscured AGNs. We measure a significant stacked X-ray signal in all of the X-ray bands examined, including, for the first time, a significant (3.2 sigma) 6-8 keV stacked X-ray signal from an X-ray undetected source population. We find that the X-ray-undetected MIPS sources make up about 2% (or less) of the total CXB below 6 keV, but about 6% in the 6-8 keV band.

This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a ``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the complementary quantities: depending on \textit{when} the box measurement is performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs.

A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription of Wolf et al.

705.0475,Production of trans-Neptunian binaries through chaos-assisted capture,"  The recent discovery of binary objects in the Kuiper-belt opens an invaluable window into past and present conditions in the trans-Neptunian part of the Solar System. For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to impose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a binary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture. Here we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the spatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is assumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric Keplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these objects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital element distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the circular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in the circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture mechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary mutual orbit inclinations.

The recent discovery of binary objects in the Kuiper-belt opens an invaluable window into past and present conditions in the trans-Neptunian part of the Solar System. For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to impose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a binary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture. Here we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the spatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is assumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric Keplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these objects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital element distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the circular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in the circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture mechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary mutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of retrograde versus prograde orbits.

We compute the set of all non-spatially diffeomorphic non-coplanar vertex embeddings for vertices of valence 5--7, and argue that these sets can be used to label spatial diffeomorphism invariant states. We observe how gauge invariance connects vertex geometry and representation properties of the underlying gauge group in a natural way.

We analyze the spectral properties of the volume operator of Ashtekar and Lewandowski in Loop Quantum Gravity, which is the quantum analogue of the classical volume expression for regions in three dimensional Riemannian space. Our analysis considers for the first time generic graph vertices of valence greater than four. Here we find that the geometry of the underlying vertex characterizes the spectral properties of the volume operator, in particular the presence of a `volume gap' (a smallest non-zero eigenvalue in the spectrum) is found to depend on the vertex embedding. We compute the set of all non-spatially diffeomorphic non-coplanar vertex embeddings for vertices of valence 5--7, and argue that these sets can be used to label spatial diffeomorphism invariant states. We observe how gauge invariance connects vertex geometry and representation properties of the underlying gauge group in a natural way.

Due to the exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurities, there arises a giant Zeeman splitting in the presence of a moderately low magnetic field. As a consequence, when the quantum well is magnetically doped the current-voltage characteristics shows two peaks corresponding to transport for each spin channel. This behavior is experimentally observed and can be reproduced with a simple tunneling model. The model thus allows to analyze other configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, which leads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads, thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstrate that the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change. Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows a large increase in peak amplitude and a shift of the resonance to higher voltages as the external field increases.

704.2886,Control of mechanical systems on Lie groups and ideal hydrodynamics,"  In contrast to the Euler-Poincar{\'e} reduction of geodesic flows of left- or right-invariant metrics on Lie groups to the corresponding Lie algebra (or its dual), one can consider the reduction of the geodesic flows to the group itself. The reduced vector field has a remarkable hydrodynamic interpretation: it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or left-invariant symmetry fields of the reduced field define vortex manifolds for such flows.   Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group and whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, and assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought from any initial position in the configuration space to another preassigned position by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, by changing the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any other preassigned vortex manifold.

Observed AGN-induced cavities/bubbles are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron emission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous studies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support, but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating is significant. Here we investigate a new model of AGN heating, in which the intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injected into the ICM through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we show that the cooling catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case, no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. The cosmic ray pressure, P_c/P_g <~ 0.1 and dP_c/dr <~ 0.1 \rho g, is well within observational bounds.

The 15-150 keV energy distribution of the GRB 050410 prompt emission shows a peak energy at 53 keV. The XRT light curve of this GRB decays as a power law with a slope of alpha=1.06+/-0.04. The spectrum is well reproduced by an absorbed power law with a spectral index Gamma_x=2.4+/-0.4 and a low energy absorption N_H=4(+3;-2)x10^21 cm^(-2) which is higher than the Galactic value. The 15-150 keV prompt emission in GRB 050412 is modelled with a hard (Gamma=0.7+/-0.2) power law. The XRT light curve follows a broken power law with the first slope alpha_1=0.7+/-0.4, the break time T_break=254(-41;+79) s and the second slope alpha_2=2.8(-0.8;+0.5). The spectrum is fitted by a power law with spectral index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.2 which is absorbed at low energies by the Galactic column. The GRB 050410 afterglow reveals the expected characteristics of the third component of the canonical Swift light curve. Conversely, a complex phenomenology was detected in the GRB 050412 because of the presence of the very early break. The light curve in this case can be interpreted as being the last peak of the prompt emission. The two bursts present tight upper limits for the optical emission, however, neither of them can be clearly classified as dark. For GRB 050410, the suppression of the optical afterglow could be attributed to a low density interstellar medium surrounding the burst.

Combined with very deep Subaru optical photometry, the depth (K_AB = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of the UDS EDR allows us to investigate optical/near-IR selection using a large sample of over 30,000 objects. By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzK technique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can be further separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzK respectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature not previously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving track of early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with the R-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection of Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between these populations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively bright magnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at these magnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxies have SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.

Taken together, our results suggest a three-step strategy toward designing more effective steady-state FRET experiments for the study of biomembranes.","['physics.chem-ph', 'physics.bio-ph']"

More specifically, we study the behavior of the viscosity (and its frequency dependence) on approaching the repulsive glass, the attractive glass and in the re-entrant region where viscosity shows a non monotonic behavior on increasing attraction strength. On approaching the glass lines, the increase of the viscosity is consistent with a power-law divergence with the same exponent and critical packing fraction previously obtained for the divergence of the density fluctuations. Based on mode-coupling calculations, we associate the increase of the viscosity with specific contributions from different length scales. We also show that the results are independent on the microscopic dynamics by comparing newtonian and brownian simulations for the same model. Finally we evaluate the Stokes-Einstein relation approaching both glass transitions, finding a clear breakdown which is particularly strong for the case of the attractive glass.

The measurements were obtained at optical, 1 mm, and 3 mm wavelengths, and at 7 mm with the Very Long Baseline Array. The data show a wide range in degree of linear polarization among the sources, from $<$1% to $>$30%, and interday polarization variability in individual sources. The polarization properties suggest separation of the sample into three groups with low, intermediate, and high variability of polarization in the core at 7 mm : LVP, IVP, and HVP, respectively. The groups are partially associated with the common classification of active galactic nuclei as radio galaxies and quasars with low optical polarization (LVP), BL Lacertae objects (IVP), and highly optically polarized quasars (HVP). Our study investigates correlations between total flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle at the different wavelengths. We interpret the polarization properties of the sources in the sample through models in which weak shocks compress turbulent plasma in the jet. The differences in the orientation of sources with respect to the observer, jet kinematics, and abundance of thermal matter external to the jet near the core can account for the diversity in the polarization properties. The results provide strong evidence that the optical polarized emission originates in shocks, most likely situated between the 3 mm and 7 mm VLBI cores.

After a suitable gauge fixing we are able to compute the bulk entropy of a bounded region (the ""black hole"") with fixed boundary. This allows us to study the relationship between the entropy and the boundary area in details and we identify a holographic regime of LQG where the leading order of the entropy scales with the area.

It is shown that the interplay between both types of spin-orbit coupling gives rise to an anisotropic spectral behavior of the spin density response function which is significantly different from that of vanishing Rashba or Dresselhaus case. Strong resonances are developed in the spin susceptibility as a consequence of the angular anisotropy of the energy spin-splitting.

704.0892,Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks,"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted, and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation types.

The method is very general, and can be readily extended to other regimes, more particles, different species (e.g., protons and neutrons in nuclear physics), or more-component fermions (as well as bosons). As an illustration, we present calculations of the lowest-energy three-fermion states away from the unitary limit and find a possible inversion of parity in the ground state in the limit of trap size large compared to the scattering length.

To this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu }\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry $SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered. However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.

704.1269,Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs,"  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).   We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree (number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses. First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine their asymptotic values for large number of colors.   Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

The effectiveness of accounting correctly for the geometry of the sphere in the wavelet analysis of full-sky CMB data is demonstrated by the highly significant detections of physical processes and effects that are made in these reviewed works.","['astro-ph', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']"

705.362,Scalar-field perturbations from a particle orbiting a black hole using   numerical evolution in 2+1 dimensions,"  We present a new technique for time-domain numerical evolution of the scalar field generated by a pointlike scalar charge orbiting a black hole. Time-domain evolution offers an efficient way for calculating black hole perturbations, especially as input for computations of the local self force acting on orbiting particles. In Kerr geometry, the field equations are not fully separable in the time domain, and one has to tackle them in 2+1 dimensions (two spatial dimensions and time; the azimuthal dependence is still separable). A technical difficulty arises when the source of the field is a pointlike particle, as the 2+1-dimensional perturbation is then singular: Each of the azimuthal modes diverges logarithmically at the particle. To deal with this problem we split the numerical domain into two regions: Inside a thin worldtube surrounding the particle's worldline we solve for a regularized variable, obtained from the full field by subtracting out a suitable ``puncture'' function, given analytically. Outside this worldtube we solve for the full, original field. The value of the evolution variable is adjusted across the boundary of the worldtube. In this work we demonstrate the applicability of this method in the example of circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole (refraining from exploiting the spherical symmetry of the background, and working in 2+1 dimensions).

The dependence on lattice strength becomes much richer in two and three dimensions. In the two-dimensional case, when the interaction is weak, the sound speed first increases then decreases as the lattice strength increases. For the three dimensional lattice, the sound speed can even oscillate with the lattice strength. These rich behaviors can be understood in terms of compressibility and effective mass. Our analytical results at the limit of weak lattices also offer an interesting perspective to the understanding: they show the lattice component perpendicular to the sound propagation increases the sound speed while the lattice components parallel to the propagation decreases the sound speed.

704.0988,Evidence for a Massive Protocluster in S255N,"  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of active star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We present mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the evolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core (SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1 also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1.

On the grounds of dynamical considerations, we test a hypothesis that the trend can be explained by the presence of an additional giant planet.

Most of these domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and proteins, and are believed to coordinate signal transduction cascades. Whether similar domains are also present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane is unclear so far. To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the diffusion of 30-40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical size of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.

To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the diffusion of 30-40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical size of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.","['physics.optics', 'physics.bio-ph']"

704.0698,Rigorous Results for the Periodic Oscillation of an Adiabatic Piston,"  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $ when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.   When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly, both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.   In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging results.

Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.   When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly, both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.   In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.","['math.DS', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']"
704.211,Stability of the superconducting state in YBa_2Cu_3O_7,"  The nonadiabatic Heisenberg model (NHM) proposed as an extension of the Heisenberg model makes a contribution to the eigenstate problem of superconductivity. The Hamiltonian H^n derived within this group-theoretical model has superconducting eigenstates if and only if the considered material possesses a narrow, roughly half-filled ""superconducting"" energy band of special symmetry in its band structure. This paper shows that the high-temperature superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_7 possesses such a superconducting band. This new result together with previous observations about other superconductors and non-superconductors corroborates the theoretical evidence within the NHM that stable superconducting states are connected with superconducting bands. It is proposed that the type of superconductivity, i.e., whether the material is a conventional low-T_c or a high-T_c superconductor, is determined by the energetically lowest boson excitations that carry the crystal spin 1*hbar and are sufficiently stable to transport this crystal spin-angular momentum through the crystal.

But whether this enhancement is a local feature (e.g., a superbubble within a distance of <= 200 pc) and/or a phenomenon related to energetic outflows from the Galactic center/bulge remains unclear. Here we report a comparative X-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gas along the sight lines toward 3C 273 and Mrk 421, on and off the enhancement, but at similar Galactic latitudes. The diffuse 3/4-keV emission intensity, as estimated from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, is about three times higher toward 3C 273 than toward Mrk 421. Based on archival \chandra grating observations of these two AGNs, we detect X-ray absorption lines (e.g., OVII Kalpha, Kbeta, and OVIII Kalpha transitions at z~0) and find that the mean hot gas thermal and kinematic properties along the two sight lines are significantly different.

We determine general conditions for the existence and stability of these non-topological soliton solutions.

On the basis of these considerations we obtain a complete characterization of the soliton-supporting members of the aforementioned class of non-linear field theories.

In the present work we restrict most of our considerations to one and many-components scalar models. We show that in these cases the finite-energy static spherically symmetric solutions are stable against charge-preserving perturbations, provided that the vacuum energy of the model vanishes and the energy density is positive definite.

The decoherence time scale for active-sterile oscillations is $\tau_{dec} = 2/\Gamma_{aa}$, but the evolution of the distribution functions is determined by the two different time scales associated with the damping rates of the quasiparticle modes in the medium: $\Gamma_1=\Gamma_{aa}\cos^2\tm ; \Gamma_2=\Gamma_{aa}\sin^2\tm$ where $\Gamma_{aa}$ is the interaction rate of the active species in absence of mixing and $\tm$ the mixing angle in the medium. These two time scales are widely different away from MSW resonances and preclude the kinetic description of active-sterile production in terms of a simple rate equation.

We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.",['astro-ph']
704.2259,The Wiretap Channel with Feedback: Encryption over the Channel,"  In this work, the critical role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a noiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in the current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is extended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\Lambda$ channel where it is shown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the capacity in the absence of the wiretapper.

We find that even slight overetching of the film leads to conductance of the STO substrate, and asymmetric and non-linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. However, a brief oxygen plasma etch allows full recovery of the insulating character of the substrate. The I-V characteristics of the bridges are then fully linear over a large range of current densities. We find colossal magnetoresistance properties typical for strained LCMO on STO but no signature of non-linear effects (so-called electroresistance) connected to electronic inhomogeneites.

We exploit calculations within a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism adjusted for QCD, in order to extract an ``experimental'' strong coupling \alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) below 1 GeV by comparison with the meson spectrum. The BS potential follows from a proper ansatz on the Wilson loop to encode confinement and is the sum of a one-gluon-exchange and a confinement terms. Besides, the common perturbative strong coupling is replaced by the ghost-free expression \alpha_E(Q^2) according to the prescription of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT). The agreement of \alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) with the APT coupling \alpha_E(Q^2) turns out to be reasonable from 1 GeV down to the 200 MeV scale, thus confirming quantitatively the validity of the APT prescription. Below this scale, the experimental points could give a hint on the vanishing of \alpha_s(Q^2) as Q approaches zero. This infrared behaviour would be consistent with some lattice results and a ``massive'' generalization of the APT approach.

Moreover, when the parameter is not too large, they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are all simple, and they ""repel"".

This $\gamma$-ray production matrix is applied to the GeV excess in diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays observed by EGRET, and we conclude the non-$\pi^0$ decay components are insufficient to explain the GeV excess, although they have contributed a different spectrum from the $\pi^0$-decay component. We also test the hypothesis that the TeV-band $\gamma$-ray emission of the shell-type SNR RX J1713.7-3946 observed with HESS is caused by hadronic cosmic rays which are accelerated by a cosmic-ray modified shock. By the $\chi^2$ statistics, we find a continuously softening spectrum is strongly preferred, in contrast to expectations. A hardening spectrum has about 1% probability to explain the HESS data, but then only if a hard cutoff at 50-100 TeV is imposed on the particle spectrum.

704.3235,XMM-Newton X-ray Observations of the Wolf-Rayet Binary System WR 147,"  We present results of a 20 ksec X-ray observation of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary system WR 147 obtained with XMM-Newton. Previous studies have shown that this system consists of a nitrogen-type WN8 star plus an OB companion whose winds are interacting to produce a colliding wind shock. X-ray spectra from the pn and MOS detectors confirm the high extinction reported from IR studies and reveal hot plasma including the first detection of the Fe K-alpha line complex at 6.67 keV. Spectral fits with a constant-temperature plane-parallel shock model give a shock temperature kT(shock) = 2.7 keV [T(shock) ~ 31 MK], close to but slightly hotter than the maximum temperature predicted for a colliding wind shock. Optically thin plasma models suggest even higher temperatures, which are not yet ruled out. The X-ray spectra are harder than can be accounted for using 2D numerical colliding wind shock models based on nominal mass-loss parameters. Possible explanations include: (i) underestimates of the terminal wind speeds or wind abundances, (ii) overly simplistic colliding wind models, or (iii) the presence of other X-ray emission mechanisms besides colliding wind shocks. Further improvement of the numerical models to include potentially important physics such as non-equilibrium ionization will be needed to rigorously test the colliding wind interpretation.

Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We introduce a software package for learning module networks, called LeMoNe, which incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise, on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators.

704.1256,"A Novel String Derived Z' With Stable Proton, Light-Neutrinos and   R-parity violation","  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number violating operators and R-parity violation.

The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV.

The method guarantees a high accuracy of the spectra with high energy and high momentum resolutions. It takes into account long-range intersite correlations as well as the strong on-site correlations. Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarified by comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation. The calculated spectra verify the quantum Monte-Carlo results for finite temperatures. The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface in the underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdoped region. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass and self-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persists even at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region because a van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that a kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region.

Thus this is an ideal method to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for (for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational configurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid solvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension of these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high order convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational grids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically fourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same order for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in the evolution.

By analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342: QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations.

704.1159,Characterization of open cluster remnants,"  Despite progress in the theoretical knowledge of open cluster remnants and the growing search for observational identifications in recent years, open questions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii) to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved binary star distributions of open clusters. ",astro-ph,"Characterization of open cluster remnants.

704.0534,Self-diffusion and Interdiffusion in Al80Ni20 Melts: Simulation and   Experiment,"  A combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts. Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the long-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a good approximation, even in the undercooled regime.

704.0085,A Universality in PP-Waves,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed.

705.2297,On the tuning of a wave-energy driven oscillating-water-column seawater   pump to polychromatic waves,"  Performance of wave-energy devices of the oscillating water column (OWC) type is greatly enhanced when a resonant condition with the forcing waves is maintained. The natural frequency of such systems can in general be tuned to resonate with a given wave forcing frequency. In this paper we address the tuning of an OWC sea-water pump to polychromatic waves. We report results of wave tank experiments, which were conducted with a scale model of the pump. Also, a numerical solution for the pump equations, which were proven in previous work to successfully describe its behavior when driven by monochromatic waves, is tested with various polychromatic wave spectra. Results of the numerical model forced by the wave trains measured in the wave tank experiments are used to develop a tuning criterion for the sea-water pump.

The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors, and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussians. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, non-detections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussians. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z < 0.8 radio-quiet quasars.

By considering simple model swimmers, and combining analytic and numerical approaches, we investigate the time-averaged flow field around a swimmer. At short distances the swimmer behaves like a pump. At large distances the velocity field depends on whether the swimming stroke is invariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then consider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of two parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which takes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous swimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the latter dominates. The swimmer--swimmer interaction is a complicated function of their relative displacement, orientation and phase, leading to motion that can be attractive, repulsive or oscillatory.

They show that the description of the fluid based on the one-particle phase-space reduced distribution function, in principle necessary because of the presence of velocity dependent collisional dissipation, can be contracted to a simpler description in configurational space. Indeed, by means of a multiple-time scale method the authors derive a self-consistent governing equation for the particle density distribution function. This equation is similar to the dynamic density functional equation employed in the study of colloids, but contains additional terms taking into account the inelastic nature of the fluid. Such terms cannot be derived from a Liapunov generating functional and contribute not only to the relaxational properties, but also to the non equilibrium steady state properties.

The near detector of the forthcoming Double Chooz experiment will collect $1.6\times10^5$ events per year, enough to determine the average neutrino direction with a $1 \sigma$ half-cone aperture of $2.3^\circ$ in one year. It is more difficult to separate the two Chooz reactors that are viewed at a separation angle $\phi=30^\circ$. If their strengths are known and approximately equal, the azimuthal location of each reactor is obtained with $\pm6^\circ$ ($1 \sigma$) and the probability of confusing them with a single source is less than 11%. Five year's data reduce this ``confusion probability'' to less than 0.3%, i.e., a $3 \sigma$ separation is possible. All of these numbers improve rapidly with increasing angular separation of the sources. For a setup with $\phi=90^\circ$ and one year's data, the azimuthal $1 \sigma$ uncertainty for each source decreases to $\pm3.2^\circ$. Of course, for Double Chooz the two reactor locations are known, allowing one instead to measure their individual one-year integrated power output to $\pm11%$ ($1 \sigma$), and their five-year integrated output to $\pm4.8%$ ($1 \sigma$).

The shoulder arises from a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the highly localized (l) and band-like (b) states. Furthermore, our theory leads to a correspondence between spectral changes due to increasing doping and decreasing T, as experimentally observed.

Interactions of this accreting gas with migrating planets may lead to short-period exoplanets like those detected around main-sequence stars. The observed water vapor is likely produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies, and provides a potential reservoir of water for terrestrial planets.

The pulsation of the objects has been modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the line cores and made abundance determination impossible.

Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energy levels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we have derived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of the occupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distribution of these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$, fluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the temperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large that the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution but actually fluctuates around it. We term this state, where not one macrostate but a region of macrostates closely fit the underlying distribution, a ``{\it fluctuating equilibrium}''.

In this case, one knows the exact solution for the polarization operator $\Pi(\mu)$, which allows one to obtain both the OPE to any order and the spectrum of states. We start with the OPE for $\Pi(\mu)$ and analyze the extraction of the square of the ground-state wave function, $R\propto|\Psi_0(\vec r=0)|^2$, from an SVZ sum rule, setting the mass of the ground state $E_0$ equal to its known value and treating the effective continuum threshold as a fit parameter. We show that in a limited ``fiducial'' range of the Borel parameter there exists a solution for the effective threshold which precisely reproduces the exact $\Pi(\mu)$ for any value of $R$ within the range $0.7 \le R/R_0 \le 1.15$ ($R_0$ is the known exact value). Thus, the value of $R$ extracted from the sum rule is determined to a great extent by the contribution of the hadron continuum.

706.0227,Zero-temperature phase of the XY spin glass in two dimensions: Genetic   embedded matching heuristic,"  For many real spin-glass materials, the Edwards-Anderson model with continuous-symmetry spins is more realistic than the rather better understood Ising variant. In principle, the nature of an occurring spin-glass phase in such systems might be inferred from an analysis of the zero-temperature properties. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding ground-state configurations is a non-polynomial problem computationally, such that efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two dimensions. We analyze bulk properties such as the asymptotic ground-state energy and the phase diagram of disorder strength vs. disorder concentration. For the case of a symmetric distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, we find that the ground state of the model is unique up to a global O(2) rotation of the spins. In particular, there are no extensive degeneracies in this model. The main focus of this work is on an investigation of the excitation spectrum as probed by changing the boundary conditions. Using appropriate finite-size scaling techniques, we consistently determine the stiffness of spin and chiral domain walls and the corresponding fractal dimensions.

The apparent universality of accretion-related outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that large-scale MHD torques facilitate vertical transport of angular momentum. This leads to an enhanced overall rate of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model demonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion disk theory. A comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of quasar spectral energy distributions suggests that mass accretion rates inferred using the standard disk model may severely underestimate their true values.

705.0511,Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation Measurement for Soil Bulk   Density Analysis,"  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases.

",physics.ins-det physics.gen-ph,"Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation Measurement for Soil Bulk   Density Analysis.   Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases.

Additionally, we identify similar features that appear to be associated with stars. Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements of the thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* and investigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed motions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to a common coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then a cross-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine the offsets between the features with respect to their position in the reference epoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2 cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that the shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the position of SgrA*.

Instead, the three brightest MIR regions all display dust continua of temperatures less than ~ 200K. These low dust temperatures indicate the dust is likely in the form of a patchy screen of relatively cold material situated along the line of sight.

We apply this technique to the spectral measurements of the CMB by the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). The second technique utilizes the change in amplitude of the TNO signal due to the orbital motion of the observer to separate the TNO signal from the invariant extra-galactic CMB and construct a map of the mass distribution in the outer Solar System.

These polymers consist of a linear backbone to which long side chains are chemically grafted. The backbone contains about 1600 monomer units (weight average) and every second monomer unit carries side-chains with ca. 60 monomer units.

An analysis of the DLS data confirm these model parameters. The scattering intensities taken at finite concentration can be modeled using the polymer reference interaction site model.

We demonstrate that the persistence decreases from 17.5 nm down to 5 nm upon increasing the concentration from dilute solution to the highest concentration 40.59 g/l under consideration.

We use three estimators: the information content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma ranges allowed by present data.

We explore the main physical processes which potentially affect the topological signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for a range of toroidal universes.

We use three estimators: the information content, the S/N statistic and the Bayesian evidence. While reionisation has nearly no effect on the estimators, we show that taking into account the ISW strongly decreases our ability to detect the topological signal. We also study the impact of varying the relevant cosmological parameters within the 2 sigma ranges allowed by present data.

704.0554,In-medium effects on particle production in heavy ion collisions,"  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions ($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and $(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios, since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its isovector sector.

704.0069,Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups.

Being proportional to top Yukawa and top mass, such contributions are often large. Analytical expressions illustrating the explicit role of the R-parity violating parameters are given following perturbative diagonalization of mass-squared matrices for the scalars. Dominant contributions come from the combinations $B_i \lambda^{\prime}_{ij1}$ for which we obtain robust bounds.

The same relations are checked to all orders in the large beta_0 limit; as a byproduct a dispersive representation of the form factor is obtained.

It is also found that these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations. The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments. However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons; there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending rigidity regime that was not studied here.

The dip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single region.

The present paper is devoted to estimating the speed of convergence towards consensus for a general class of discrete-time multi-agent systems. In the systems considered here, both the topology of the interconnection graph and the weight of the arcs are allowed to vary as a function of time. Under the hypothesis that some spanning tree structure is preserved along time, and that some nonzero minimal weight of the information transfer along this tree is guaranteed, an estimate of the contraction rate is given. The latter is expressed explicitly as the spectral radius of some matrix depending upon the tree depth and the lower bounds on the weights.",['math.OC']
704.3007,Deformation quantization modules on complex symplectic manifolds,"  We study modules over the algebroid stack $\W[\stx]$ of deformation quantization on a complex symplectic manifold $\stx$ and recall some results: construction of an algebra for $\star$-products, existence of (twisted) simple modules along smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, perversity of the complex of solutions for regular holonomic $\W[\stx]$-modules, finiteness and duality for the composition of ``good'' kernels. As a corollary, we get that the derived category of good $\W[\stx]$-modules with compact support is a Calabi-Yau category. We also give a conjectural Riemann-Roch type formula in this framework.

705.0865,Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking,"  We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed. ",hep-ph hep-th,"Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking.

704.3082,Neumann and Neumann-Rosochatius integrable systems from membranes on   AdS_4xS^7,"  It is known that large class of classical string solutions in the type IIB AdS_5xS^5 background is related to the Neumann and Neumann-Rosochatius integrable systems, including spiky strings and giant magnons. It is also interesting if these integrable systems can be associated with some membrane configurations in M-theory. We show here that this is indeed the case by presenting explicitly several types of membrane embedding in AdS_4xS^7 with the searched properties.

704.1814,A Measure of de Sitter Entropy and Eternal Inflation,"  We show that in any model of non-eternal inflation satisfying the null energy condition, the area of the de Sitter horizon increases by at least one Planck unit in each inflationary e-folding. This observation gives an operational meaning to the finiteness of the entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter space eventually exiting into an asymptotically flat region: the asymptotic observer is never able to measure more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary modes. This suggests a limitation on the amount of de Sitter space outside the horizon that can be consistently described at the semiclassical level, fitting well with other examples of the breakdown of locality in quantum gravity, such as in black hole evaporation. The bound does not hold in models of inflation that violate the null energy condition, such as ghost inflation. This strengthens the case for the thermodynamical interpretation of the bound as conventional black hole thermodynamics also fails in these models, strongly suggesting that these theories are incompatible with basic gravitational principles.

704.3279,Un-renormalized Classical Electromagnetism,"  This paper follows in the tradition of direct-action versions of electromagnetism having the aim of avoiding a balance of infinities wherein a mechanical mass offsets an infinite electromagnetic mass so as to arrive at a finite observed value. Given that, in this respect the direct-action approached ultimately failed because its initial exclusion of self-action was found to be untenable in the relativistic domain, this paper continues the tradition considering instead a version of electromagnetism wherein mechanical action is excluded and self-action is retained. It is shown that the resulting theory is effectively interacting due to the presence of infinite forces. A vehicle for the investigation is a pair of classical point charges in a positronium-like arrangement for which the orbits are found to be self-sustaining and naturally quantized.
